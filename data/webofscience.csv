The indicators assessed in this review fall within the impact category of the driver-pressure-state-impact-response (DPSIR) framework. Instrumental records have shown unequivocal changes in climatic conditions over the past 30 years at a global level but impact indicators allow these changes to be monitored at a finer resolution. Our main aim was to review sets of indicators of climate change currently used in various countries and to make recommendations for their use in the Irish environment. We review a preliminary set of climate change impact indicators in five sectors: agriculture; plant and animal distribution,patterns; phenology; palaeoecology and human health. Currently, the most effective impact indicators of climate change have proved to be phenological observations of tree developmental stages. The strongest factor limiting the use of indicators is the lack of long-term data sets from which a climatic signal can be extracted.","Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Dept Bot, Dublin 2, Ireland; Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Ctr Environm, Dublin 2, Ireland; Natl Univ Ireland, Dept Geog, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland",,"Donnelly, A (corresponding author), Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Dept Bot, Dublin 2, Ireland.",alison.donnelly@tcd.ie,,,,,,44,33,43,3,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0020-7128,1432-1254,,INT J BIOMETEOROL,Int.

This is a region that is known from previous work ( through evidence of pottery, furnaces and charcoal layers beneath the present day rainforest vegetation) to have had prehistoric settlement dating back to at least 2000 calibrated years before present. In addition, there is climatic evidence to suggest that significant variations in precipitation have occurred in central Africa over the last few millennia. Presently, the region is covered in uninhabited moist semi-evergreen rainforest. Key research questions addressed in this paper include the extent to which the present-day composition of rainforest in this region is as a result of processes of the past ( climate change and/or human activity), and the resilience of the rainforest to these perturbations. Statistical analyses of pollen, microscopic charcoal and geochemical data are used to determine the relationship over time between vegetation dynamics and climate change, anthropogenic burning and metal smelting. Significant changes in forest composition are linked to burning and climate change but not metallurgy. The strongest influence on the present day composition appears to be related to the increased anthropogenic burning that started approximately 1000 years ago. Results from this study are discussed in terms of their implications for the present and future management of this globally important forested region.","Univ Oxford, Ctr Environm, Oxford Longterm Ecol Lab, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; Univ Oxford, Ctr Environm, Climate Res Grp, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; Royal Bot Gardens, Edinburgh EH3 5LR, Midlothian, Scotland",,"Brncic, TM (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Ctr Environm, Oxford Longterm Ecol Lab, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",terry.brncic@linacre.oxon.org,,"Washington, Richard/0000-0003-2521-4614; Harris, David/0000-0002-6801-2484; Willis, Katherine/0000-0002-6763-2489",Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/C510667/1] Funding Source: researchfish,,,80,86,87,1,39,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8436,1471-2970,,PHILOS T R SOC B,Philos.

Restoration targets are often based primarily on monitoring data and modeling simulations, which provide information on species' short-term response to disturbance and environmental variables. Consequently, the targets may be unsustainable under the spectrum of natural variability inherent in the system or under future climate change. Increasingly, ecologists and restoration planners recognize the value of the long temporal perspective provided by paleoecological data. Advances in paleoclimatology, including better climate proxy methods and temporal resolution, contribute to our understanding of ecosystem response to anthropogenic and climatic forcing at all time scales. We highlight paleoecological research in the Chesapeake Bay and the Florida Everglades and summarize the resulting contributions to restoration planning.

Diatoms are common in the pro. le, which we subdivide into three zones. Zone C (similar to 3240 - 1020 cal yr B. P.) is dominated by Staurosira construens var. venter and Aulacoseira spp.; during this time, the lake was dilute and circumneutral. Benthic and acidophilous taxa increase gradually in the upper section of this zone. Zone B (similar to 1020 - 460 cal yr B. P.) almost totally lacks Aulacoseira, and instead is dominated by combinations of Eunotia minor, Encyonema lunatum, Gomphonema gracile, and Pinnularia braunii. Previous pollen and charcoal analysis indicates that this zone falls within the peak of prehistoric agricultural activity at the lake, but diatoms may also reflect climate change. During this period, the lake was likely shallower and more acidic, but not eutrophic. Finally, Zone A (similar to 460 cal yr B. P. to AD 1997) begins near a 1.5-cm tephra layer from nearby Volcan Baru; diatom assemblages are dominated by Aulacoseira spp., and suggest deepening of the lake and return to conditions similar to Zone C. This was a time of indigenous population decline and forest recovery in the Zoncho region, probably reflecting the impact of European diseases on the native population, although climate change and impacts of the tephra deposition cannot be wholly discounted.","NW Missouri State Univ, Dept Biol, Maryville, MO 64468 USA; Univ Tennessee, Dept Geog, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA",,"Haberyan, KA (corresponding author), NW Missouri State Univ, Dept Biol, Maryville, MO 64468 USA.",khaber@mail.nwmissouri.edu,"Horn, Sally/B-1918-2013","Horn, Sally/0000-0002-0575-3664",,,,36,20,20,2,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-2728,1573-0417,,J PALEOLIMNOL,J.

This study demonstrates that these correlations are also recognizable in late Quaternary assemblages from three locations in the South Atlantic on temporal and latitudinal scales. The size response to temporal paleoenvironmental changes during glacial-interglacial cycles mimics the geographic Holocene size variability. The amplitude of size variability is directly related to the amplitude of the climatic fluctuations as shown by the stable size-temperature relationship over time. The documented changes in the assemblage size are caused by species replacement and intraspecific size variability. The relative importance of these processes depends on the environmental setting. Species have been shown to reach their maximum size and abundance under certain optimum conditions and decrease in size if environmental conditions differ from these optima. We confirm that late Quaternary species sizes were largest at paleotemperatures identical to Holocene ones.","ETH, Inst Geol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",,"Schmidt, DN (corresponding author), Univ London, Royal Holloway & Bedford New Coll, Dept Geol, London, England.",,"Renaud, Sabrina/AAV-3141-2020; Renaud, Sabrina/D-4247-2009","Renaud, Sabrina/0000-0002-8730-3113; Renaud, Sabrina/0000-0002-8730-3113; Schmidt, Daniela/0000-0001-8419-2721",,,,62,29,30,1,7,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0883-8305,,,PALEOCEANOGRAPHY,Paleoceanography,MAY 22,2003,18,2,,,,,,,1039,10.1029/2002PA000831,,,12,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Oceanography; Paleontology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Geology; Oceanography; Paleontology,683ZK,WOS:000183180800004,,,,,2022-02-14

The results point to a succession of dramatic climatic fluctuations. '' Cool-water indicators '' (Ahmuellerella octoradiata, Kamptnerius magnificus and Nephrolithus frequens) suggest cool surface water conditions prevailed during Chron C30n. At the top of C30n, their sudden drop in abundance, the last occurrence of B. constans and the concomitant increase in the tropical species Micula murus suggest warming and lower surface water productivity. An M murus acme within Chron C29r reflects maximum warming. During the last 100 kyr of the Maastrichtian, the decrease in M murus and increase in cool-water indicators reflect rapid cooling with the cool climate persisting over. The calcareous nannoplankton response to climate change correlate with similar findings in the Equatorial Atlantic Hole 1258A and parallels the stable isotope record of planktic and benthic foraminifera of DSDP Hole 525A as well as the decline in Os-187/Os-188.

Reconstructing the Late Miocene climate and oceanic heat flux using the AGCM ECHAM4 coupled to a mixed-layer ocean model with adjusted flux correction. Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 238, 399-423] demonstrates some realistic trends: the high latitudes are warmer than today and the meridional temperature gradient is reduced. However, the Tortonian run also indicates some insufficiencies such as too cool mid-latitudes which can be due to an underestimated pCO(2) in the atmosphere. As a sensitivity study, we perform a further model experiment for which we additionally increase the atmospheric carbon dioxide (700 ppm). According to this CO2 sensitivity experiment, we find a global warming and a globally more intense water cycle as compared to the previous Tortonian run. Particularly the high latitudes are warmer in the Tortonian CO2 sensitivity run which leads to a lower amount of Arctic sea ice and a reduced equator-to-pole temperature difference. Our Tortonian CO2 sensitivity study basically agrees with results from recent climate model experiments which consider an increase of CO2 during the next century (e.g. [Cubasch, U., Meehl, G.A., Boer, G.J., Stouffer, R.J., Dix, M., Noda, A., Senior, C.A., Raper, S., Yap, K.S., 2001.

Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 525-582]) suggesting that the climatic response on a higher atmospheric CO2 concentration is almost independent from the different settings of boundary conditions (Tortonian versus today). To validate the Tortonian model simulations, we perform a quantitative comparison with terrestrial proxy data. This comparison demonstrates that the Tortonian CO2 sensitivity experiment tends to be more realistic than the previous Tortonian simulation by Steppuhn et al. [Steppuhn, A., Micheels, A., Geiger, G., Mosbrugger, V, 2006. Reconstructing the Late Miocene climate and oceanic heat flux using the ALCM ECHAM4 coupled to a mixed-layer ocean model with adjusted flux correction. Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 238, 399-423]. However, a high carbon dioxide concentration of 700 ppm is questionable for the Late Miocene, and it cannot explain shortcomings of our Tortonian run with 'normal' CO2. In order to fully understand the Late Miocene climate, further model experiments should also consider the palaeovegetation.

Distinctive spores of the dung fungus Sporornziella are used as a proxy for megafaunal biomass, and charcoal particle analysis as a proxy for fire history. A decline in spore values at all sites is closely followed by a stratigraphic charcoal rise. It is inferred that the regional collapse of a megaherbivory regime was followed by landscape transformation by humans. Correlation with the pollen stratigraphy indicates these developments began many centuries in advance of the Younger Dryas climatic reversal at the end of the Pleistocene. However, throughout the region, the latest bone collagen dates for Mannnut are considerably later, suggesting that megaherbivores lasted until the beginning of the Younger Dryas, well after initial population collapse. This evidence is consistent with the interpretation that rapid overkill on the part of humans initiated the extinction process. Landscape transformation and climate change then may have contributed to a cascade of effects that culminated in the demise of all the largest members of North America's mammal fauna.","Fordham Univ, Lincoln Ctr, Dept Nat Sci, New York, NY 10023 USA; Fordham Univ, Louis Calder Biol Stn, Armonk, NY 10504 USA; Fordham Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Bronx, NY 10458 USA",,"Robinson, GS (corresponding author), Fordham Univ, Lincoln Ctr, Dept Nat Sci, 113 W 60th St, New York, NY 10023 USA.",grobinon@fordham.edu,,"robinson, guy/0000-0002-0007-4785",,,,77,105,112,2,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

Evidence from paleontology, climatology, archaeology, and ecology now supports the idea that humans contributed to extinction on some continents, but human hunting was not solely responsible for the pattern of extinction everywhere. instead, evidence suggests that the intersection of human impacts with pronounced climatic change drove the precise timing and geography of extinction in the Northern Hemisphere. The story from the Southern Hemisphere is still unfolding. New evidence from Australia supports the view that humans helped cause extinctions there, but the correlation with climate is weak or contested.

Their abundance indicates that the special ecological conditions in extant Caribbean tropical mountain streams already ruled the ancient ecosystem. The results arising from the fossils of these freshwater organisms do not coincide with the faunal changes shown by other groups of insects.

Fossil pollen is commonly interpreted as suggesting that the range of many temperate tree species expanded at rates of 100-1000 m/yr during the early Holocene. We used chloroplast DNA surveys to show that the geography of postglacial range expansion in two eastern North American tree species differs from that expected from pollen-based reconstructions and from patterns emerging from European molecular studies. Molecular evidence suggests that American beech (Fagus grandifolia) and red maple (Acer rubrum) persisted during the late glaciation as low-density populations, perhaps within 500 km of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Because populations were closer to modern range limits than previously thought, postglacial migration rates may have been slower than those inferred from fossil pollen. Our estimated rates of < 100 m/yr are consistent with model predictions based on life history and dispersal data, and suggest that past migration rates were substantially slower than the rates that will be needed to track 21st-century warming.","Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; Duke Univ, Program Ecol, Durham, NC 27708 USA",,"McLachlan, JS (corresponding author), Harvard Forest, POB 68, Petersham, MA 01366 USA.",jsmclach@fas.harvard.edu,,,,,,70,420,426,1,160,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,AUG,2005,86,8,,,,,2088,2098,,10.1890/04-1036,,,11,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,953KO,WOS:000231075400016,,,,,2022-02-14

This strongly suggests to some investigators that a more interesting extinction debate lies within the realm of potential human-caused explanations and how climate might exacerbate human impacts.

The combination of total organic carbon concentration (TOC), total nitrogen concentration (TN), organic carbon isotope (delta C-13) and atomic C/N ratio shows that the organic matter in the sediments with many seal hairs has a marine origin, predominantly derived from seal excrements. Among the determined element/oxide concentrations, S, Se, F, Zn, Hg, FeO and P2O5 were found to be remarkably enriched in the sediments influenced by seal excrements with respect to the sediments with few or without seal hairs, and their concentrations displayed strong and positive correlations with organic matter abundance, indicating that they had the same source and transportation mechanism as the in situ organic material. A comparison of these element/oxide concentrations with the seal hair numbers showed that they had similar distribution patterns with depth, and the correlations were positive and statistically significant.

Five major themes emerge from this research. First the pilot cores and seismic data show that El'gygytygn Crater Lake contains what is expected to be the longest, most continuous terrestrial record of past climate change in the entire Arctic back to the time of impact. Second, processes operating in the El'gygytygn basin lead to changes in the limnogeology and the biogeochemistry that reflect robust changes in the regional climate and paleoecology over a large part of the western Arctic. Third, the magnetic susceptibility and other proxies record numerous rapid change events. The recovered lake sediment contains both the best-resolved record of the last interglacial and the longest terrestrial record of millennial scale climate change in the Arctic, yielding a high fidelity multi-proxy record extending nearly 150,000 years beyond what has been obtained from the Greenland Ice Sheet. Fourth, the potential for evaluating teleconnections under different mean climate states is high. Despite the heterogeneous nature of recent Arctic climate change, millennial scale climate events in the North Atlantic/Greenland region are recorded in the most distal regions of the Arctic under variable boundary conditions. Finally, deep drilling of the complete depositional record in Lake El'gygytgyn will offer new insights and, perhaps, surprises into the late Cenozoic evolution of Arctic climate.","Univ Massachusetts, Dept Geosci, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; Univ Leipzig, Inst Geol & Geophys, D-7010 Leipzig, Germany; RAS, N E Interdisciplinary Sci Res Inst FEB, Magadan 685000, Russia",,"Brigham-Grette, J (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Geosci, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",juliebg@geo.umass.edu,"Melles, Martin/J-4070-2012","Melles, Martin/0000-0003-0977-9463",,,,98,58,59,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-2728,1573-0417,,J PALEOLIMNOL,J.

Reasons for this imbalance are (1) incomplete taxonomic knowledge of chironomid faunas outside Europe and North America, (2) a scarcity of ecological data on local species and genera that might confer bio-indicator value to them, and (3) logistic difficulties hampering the lake surveying necessary to develop paleoenvironmental calibration data sets. Thus far, most chironomid paleoecology in tropical and Southern Hemisphere regions has relied on an indicator-species approach, combining autecological information on local species of which larval morphology is known with the traditional ecological typology of chironomid genera transferred from the Holarctic region. This paper reviews work accomplished to date in tropical and temperate South America, Australia, Africa, and New Zealand, including studies on various families of non-chironomid Diptera with diagnostic fossils. Research has focused mostly on late-Glacial and Holocene climate reconstruction, less on tracing past human disturbance of aquatic ecosystems and their drainage basins. Quantitative chironomid-based paleoenvironmental reconstruction has so far been done only in Australia and Africa. These studies compensated for the lack of traditional surface- sediment calibration data sets, nowadays often the main source of quantitative information on species ecological optima and tolerances, by maximally exploiting archival species-distribution data based on live collections of adult and/or larval midges. This stimulated efforts to achieve trustworthy species-level identification of fossil chironomid remains, and, as a result, the taxonomic resolution of paleoecological studies in Australia and Africa is higher on average than that achieved in European and North American studies.

The statistics of extremes have played only a very limited role in ecological modeling, despite the disproportionate influence of unusual disturbances on ecosystems. An overview of this theory is provided, with emphasis on recent developments that both make more efficient use of the available data on extremes and enable applications that are more ecologically realistic. Consistent with the emphasis on scale in ecology, scaling properties of extremes are emphasized. It is argued that the existence of distributions whose extreme upper tail is heavy (i.e., decreases at a relatively slow rate) implies that ecological disturbances are sometimes regarded as more surprising than they ought to be. The application focuses on modeling disturbances in paleoecology. Two examples are considered: the first, a sediment yield time series for Nicolay Lake in the high Arctic, reflects only the influence of hydrologic disturbances; the second, a sediment rate time series in the Chesapeake Bay, includes both climatic and anthropogenic influences. Strong evidence supports a heavy-tailed distribution for the Nicolay Lake sediment yield, but not necessarily for the Chesapeake Bay sediment rates. For each example, it is demonstrated how the statistics of extremes can readily incorporate information about covariates, such as large-scale atmospheric-oceanic circulation patterns or land use.","Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Environm & Societal Impacts Grp, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Engn, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",,"Katz, RW (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Environm & Societal Impacts Grp, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.",rwk@ucar.edu,"Brush, Grace S./A-3288-2010; Katz, Richard W/K-4133-2012; Parlange, Marc/A-3403-2015","Brush, Grace S./0000-0003-1280-5933; Katz, Richard W/0000-0002-0267-8953; Parlange, Marc/0000-0001-6972-4371",,,,48,166,173,1,64,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAY,2005,86,5,,,,,1124,1134,,10.1890/04-0606,,,11,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,924DW,WOS:000228960000006,,Green Submitted,,,2022-02-14

Using indicator taxa, pollen accumulation rates (PARs) and multivariate comparison of fossil and modern pollen assemblages, we reconstructed the vegetational changes at Upper Capsule Lake (Sagavanirktok surface) and Red Green Lake (Itkillik II surface) in response to increased effective moisture between the early and middle Holocene. 2 In the Red Green record, low PARs and the continuous presence of taxa indicative of prostrate-shrub tundra (PST; Equisetum, Polypodiaceae, Thalictrum and Rosaceae) indicate that the vegetation resembled PST throughout the Holocene. During the warm, dry early Holocene (11 300-10 000 cal years BP), PST also occurred on Sagavanirktok surfaces, as evidenced by PST indicators (Bryidae, Polypodiaceae, Equisetum and Rosaceae) in this interval of the Upper Capsule record. However, PARs increased, suggesting increased vegetation cover, PST taxa declined and taxa indicative of dwarf-shrub tundra (DST; Rubus chamaemorus and Lycopodium annotinum) increased between 10 000 and 7500 cal years BP. 3 We hypothesize that between the early and middle Holocene the fine-textured soils and smooth topography of Sagavanirktok surfaces led to increased soil moisture, greater vegetation cover, permafrost aggradation, anoxic and acidic soil conditions, slower decomposition and the development of a thick organic layer. In contrast, soil moisture remained low on the better-drained Itkillik II surface, and vegetational changes were minor. 4 Landscape-scale substrate variations have an effect on how tundra responds to climate change, suggesting that the response of arctic ecosystems to future variability may be spatially heterogeneous.","Univ Washington, Coll Forest Resources, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Quaternary Res Ctr, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; Univ Illinois, Dept Geol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",,"Oswald, WW (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Harvard Forest,POB 68, Petersham, MA 01366 USA.",,"Kling, George W/C-7867-2015","Kling, George W/0000-0002-6349-8227",,,,78,38,38,0,26,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

There have been significant efforts to model the spatial representation of pollen records in lake sediments which is important for more precise interpretation of the pollen records in terms of past vegetation patterns. We review the difficulties in matching modelled post-glacial plant migration patterns with pollen-based palaeorecords and discuss the potential of DNA analysis of pollen to investigate the ancestry and past migration pathways of the plants. In population ecology there has been an acceleration of the widely advocated conceptual advance of pollen-analytical research from vaguely defined 'environmental reconstructions' towards investigating more precisely defined ecological problems aligned with the current ecological theories. Examples of such research have included an increasing number of investigations about the ecological impacts of past disturbances, often integrating pollen records with other palaeoecological data. Such an approach has also been applied to incorporate a time perspective to the questions of ecosystem restoration, nature conservation and forest management. New lines of research are the use of pollen analysis to study long-term patterns of vegetation diversity, such as the role of glacial-age vegetation fragmentation as a cause of Amazonian rain forest diversity, and to investigate links between pollen richness and past plant diversity. Palaeoclimatological use of pollen records has become more quantitative and has included more precise and rigorous testing of pollen-climate calibration models with modern climate data. These tests show the approximate nature of the models and warn against a too straightforward climatic interpretation of the small-scale variation in reconstructions. Pollen-based climate reconstructions over the Late Glacial-early Holocene boundary have indicated that pollen-stratigraphical changes have been rapid with no evidence for response lags. This does not rule out the possibility of migrational disequilibrium, however, as the rapid changes may be mostly due to nonmigrational responses of existing vegetation. It is therefore difficult to assess whether the amplitude of reconstructed climate change reflects real climate change. Other outstanding problems remain the obscure relationship of pollen production and climate, the role of human impact and other nonclimatic factors, and nonanalogue situations.","Uppsala Univ, Dept Earth Sci, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden",,"Seppa, H (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Geol, POB 64, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",Heikki.Seppa@helsinki.fi,"Bennett, Keith D/C-8619-2009","Bennett, Keith D/0000-0002-3423-1531",,,,158,93,98,5,74,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0309-1333,1477-0296,,PROG PHYS GEOG,Prog.

We argue here that all three of these outcomes involve evolutionary processes. Genetic differentiation within species is ubiquitous, commonly via adaptation of populations to differing environmental conditions. Detectable adaptive divergence evolves on a time scale comparable to change in climate, within decades for herbaceous plant species, and within centuries or millennia for longer-lived trees, implying that biologically significant evolutionary response can accompany temporal change in climate. Models and empirical studies suggest that the speed with which a population adapts to a changing environment affects invasion rate of new habitat and thus migration rate, population growth rate and thus probability of extinction, and growth and mortality of individual plants and thus productivity of regional vegetation. Recent models and experiments investigate the stability of species tolerance limits, the influence of environmental gradients on marginal populations, and the interplay of demography, gene flow, mutation rate, and other genetic processes on the rate of adaptation to changed environments. New techniques enable ecologists to document adaptation to changing conditions directly by resurrecting ancient populations from propagules buried in decades-old sediment. Improved taxonomic resolution from morphological studies of macrofossils and DNA recovered from pollen grains and macroremains provides additional information on range shifts, changes in population sizes, and extinctions. Collaboration between paleoecologists and evolutionary biologists can refine interpretations of paleorecords, and improve predictions of biotic response to anticipated climate change.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; Univ Minnesota, Dept Biol, Duluth, MN 55812 USA",,"Davis, MB (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",mbdavis@ecology.umn.edu,,"Etterson, Julie/0000-0001-6657-0610",,,,47,481,492,14,422,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,2005,86,7,,,,,1704,1714,,10.1890/03-0788,,,11,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,941YH,WOS:000230249600006,,Green Submitted,,,2022-02-14

This unusual extinction of large and slow-breeding animals provides some of the strongest support for a human contribution to their extinction and is consistent with various human hunting models, but it is difficult to explain by models relying solely on environmental change. It is an oversimplification, however, to say that a wave of hunting-induced extinctions swept continents immediately after first human contact. Results from recent studies suggest that humans precipitated extinction in many parts of the globe through combined direct (hunting) and perhaps indirect (competition, habitat alteration) impacts, but that the timing and geography of extinction might have been different and the worldwide magnitude less, had not climatic change coincided with human impacts in many places.","Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Museums Paleontol & Vertebrate Zool, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,"Koch, PL (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",pkoch@pmc.ucsc.edu; barnosky@berkeley.edu,,,,,,125,484,503,15,410,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",1543-592X,1545-2069,,ANNU REV ECOL EVOL S,Annu.

Pollen analysis shows a rapid transition from oak ( Quercus spp.)-dominated woodland to a relatively open pine ( Pinus spp.) forest at 1450 cal. yr BP, and a more closed-canopy pine forest beginning about 700 cal. yr BP. We calculated accumulation rates of 125-250 mm charcoal fragments ( CHAR) in contiguous 0.5 cm thick sediment samples, each representing 7-10 years. Graminoid charcoal fragments were tallied separately to track the relative abundance of grass charcoal. During the oak period charcoal peaks have relatively weak periodicity and relatively high accumulation rates of grass charcoal. Charcoal peaks are less frequent ( with a periodicity of 130 - 200 years), and larger during the open-canopy pine period, with lower grass CHAR. CHAR of both charcoal types decreases further between 1000 and 850 cal. yr BP and remains low until the period of European settlement. Several hundred years later ( 700 cal. yr BP) white pine pollen increases and pollen from herbaceous taxa decreases, suggesting a more mesic, closed-canopy forest. Our results demonstrate that the vegetation and fire regime at this sandplain site changed substantially, but apparently not synchronously, during the last 2300 years, a period when millennial-scale regional climate was relatively similar to modern.","Luther Coll, Dept Biol, Decorah, IA 52101 USA; Univ Minnesota, Dept Geol & Geophys, Limnol Res Ctr, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Bot Dept, Madison, WI 53706 USA",,"Lynch, EA (corresponding author), Luther Coll, Dept Biol, Decorah, IA 52101 USA.",lynchbet@luther.edu,,,,,,74,20,20,0,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0959-6836,1477-0911,,HOLOCENE,Holocene,JUN,2006,16,4,,,,,495,504,,10.1191/0959683606hl945rp,,,10,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Physical Geography; Geology,055GS,WOS:000238438800003,,,,,2022-02-14

Traditionally, there has been an extremely limited use of long-term ecological records ( greater than 50 years) in biodiversity conservation. There are a number of reasons why such records tend to be discounted, including a perception of poor scale of resolution in both time and space, and the lack of accessibility of long temporal records to non-specialists. Probably more important, however, is the perception that even if suitable temporal records are available, their roles are purely descriptive, simply demonstrating what has occurred before in Earth's history, and are of little use in the actual practice of conservation. This paper asks why this is the case and whether there is a place for the temporal record in conservation management. Key conservation initiatives related to extinctions, identification of regions of greatest diversity/ threat, climate change and biological invasions are addressed. Examples of how a temporal record can add information that is of direct practicable applicability to these issues are highlighted. These include ( i) the identification of species at the end of their evolutionary lifespan and therefore most at risk from extinction, ( ii) the setting of realistic goals and targets for conservation 'hotspots', and ( iii) the identification of various management tools for the maintenance/restoration of a desired biological state. For climate change conservation strategies, the use of long-term ecological records in testing the predictive power of species envelope models is highlighted, along with the potential of fossil records to examine the impact of sea-level rise. It is also argued that a long- term perspective is essential for the management of biological invasions, not least in determining when an invasive is not an invasive. The paper concludes that often inclusion of a long- term ecological perspective can provide a more scientifically defensible basis for conservation decisions than the one based only on contemporary records. The pivotal issue of this paper is not whether long- term records are of interest to conservation biologists, but how they can actually be utilized in conservation practice and policy.","Univ Oxford, Ctr Environm, Longterm Ecol Lab, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Biodivers & Evolutionary Biol, E-28006 Madrid, Spain; Palaeobiol, Dept Earth Sci, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden",,"Willis, KJ (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Ctr Environm, Longterm Ecol Lab, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",kathy.willis@ouce.ox.ac.uk,"Araújo, Miguel/B-6117-2008; Bennett, Keith D/C-8619-2009; Froyd, Cynthia/A-8488-2012; Araújo, Miguel Bastos/AAE-7694-2019; Rangel, Blanca L.

The well documented no-analog plant communities of late-glacial North America are closely linked to novel climates also lacking modem analogs, characterized by high seasonality of temperature. In climate simulations for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change A2 and 131 emission scenarios, novel climates arise by 2100 AD, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. These future novel climates are warmer than any present climates globally, with spatially variable shifts in precipitation, and increase the risk of species reshuffling into future no-analog communities and other ecological surprises. Most ecological models are at least partially parameterized from modem observations and so may fail to accurately predict ecological responses to these novel climates.

A taphonomic and sedimentologic study carried out in this area allows a reconstruction of Late Carboniferous vegetation in an intramontane context. The paleoecology of such limnic settings is poorly known, and this study permits detailed comparison with paralic basins for the first time. The Graissessac peat mires developed in abandoned fluvial channels, in flood-plains, and above distal alluvial fans. The vegetation was dominated by monospecific stands of the arborescent lycopsid Sigillaria brardii, whereas the tree fern Psaronius occurred during the later stages of mire accretion. This is in contrast to coeval North American peat mires, which generally were dominated by tree ferns and pteridosperms throughout the mire profile. Stephanian floodplains and distal alluvial fans of the Graissessac-Lodeve Basin were devoid of vegetation, with the exception of isolated thickets of sphenopsids that were composed of Calamites and Sphenophyllum. These plants were found growing in situ in the floodplain mudstones as well as in fine-grained sands of secondary channels. Parautochthonous foliage assemblages of ferns and pteridosperms found in floodplain mudstones represent the most diverse plant community. The plants supplying these remains were growing in exposed areas close to floodplains. Large logs attributed to cordaitaleans and monotypic assemblages of large Cordaites leaves were found in fluvial sediments, and suggest that the plants were riparian elements in the basin.","Zona Univ Pedralbes, Fac Geol, Dept Estratig Paleontol & Geosci Marines, Barcelona 08028, Catalonia, Spain; CIRAD, UMR Bot & Bioinformat, F-34398 Paris, France",,"Martin-Closas, C (corresponding author), Zona Univ Pedralbes, Fac Geol, Dept Estratig Paleontol & Geosci Marines, Barcelona 08028, Catalonia, Spain.",cmartin@natura.geo.ub.es,"Bornette, Gudrun/B-3938-2009; Martín-Closas, Carles/AAF-8460-2021","Martin-Closas, Carles/0000-0003-4349-738X",,,,47,33,35,0,6,SEPM-SOC SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY,TULSA,"6128 EAST 38TH ST, STE 308, TULSA, OK 74135-5814 USA",0883-1351,1938-5323,,PALAIOS,Palaios,JUN,2005,20,3,,,,,249,265,,10.2110/palo.2003.p03-119,,,17,Geology; Paleontology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Geology; Paleontology,934JD,WOS:000229704200005,,,,,2022-02-14

While these claims have been critiqued by archaeologists they continue to be accepted by non-archaeologists, including Quaternary scientists. The purpose of this paper is to assess the available evidence and published arguments and to provide a constructive working synthesis of evidence for the palaeoenvironniental setting of northwestern South Asia for the mid- to late Holocene, especially ca 4000-1000cal BC, and its possible connection to important Cultural changes. We conclude that Harappan urbanism emerged on the face of a prolonged trend towards declining rainfall. No climatic event call be blamed for a precipitous end of this civilisation, although strategic local shifts in agriculture that may have begun ill response to prolonged droughts at ca 2200 BC may have contributed to the de-urbanisation process and the restructuring of communities over the following 200-300yr.

Muller) Haworth is reviewed from the literature. The species is widely distributed across Northern Europe, Scandinavia and North America, Japan, China, Australia and New Zealand, in the last usually as fo. subborealis. The species is rare in the Tropics and positive identifications are lacking for Africa. The importance of correct identification is stressed because literature reports of its occurrence often need revision. A comparison is made between two sites with detailed records of its seasonal cycle. Bletham Tarn. England, is a clear-water seasonally stratified lake; Lough Neagh, Northern Ireland, is a very large turbid and unstratified lake. In spite of their contrasting characters, Aulacoseira subarctica succeeds in both lakes. In Blelham Tarn. there is a strong seasonal cycle of growth, dormancy on the sediment and further growth on re-suspension. In Lough Neagh, there is a large deposition of cells at the end of the spring bloom but few of these cells survive grazing by benthic animals. Fossil occurrences are summarized from the species' initial appearance in the Pliocene and its later occurrence during the last inter-glacial (Eemian) deposits in NW Europe, where it is an important ecological indicator. Palaeolimnological studies are reviewed to describe the contemporary distribution and ecological preference of this widespread diatom. Aulacoseira subarctica usually appears in response to moderate increases in nutrients but is disadvantaged by further enrichment. In Blelham Tarn the species only became abundant during the twentieth century, reaching a peak between 1930 and 1960. With nutrient enrichment, abundance has declined. In Lough Neagh, it has been present for much of the post-glacial period and still thrives today in spite of the highly enriched state of the take. The species has disappeared from many eutrophic lakes and its sustained existence in Lough Neagh is anomalous. Lough Neagh may continue to offer a favourable habitat in spite of the poor light climate because the water depth, lack of stratification and long water retention time reduce losses to a sustainable level.","Dept Agr No Ireland, Agr & Environm Sci Div, Belfast BT9 5PX, Antrim, North Ireland; Queens Univ Belfast, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; GEUS, Geol Survey Denmark & Greenland, DK-1350 Copenhagen K, Denmark; Freshwater Biol Assoc, Ambleside LA22 0LP, Cumbria, England",,"Gibson, CE (corresponding author), Dept Agr No Ireland, Agr & Environm Sci Div, Newforge Lane, Belfast BT9 5PX, Antrim, North Ireland.",,,,,,,120,78,96,0,17,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-0262,,,EUR J PHYCOL,Eur.

Spatiotemporal comparison of the growth records showed statistically significant correlation during the 19th century A.D., indicative of ecosystemindependent response to pre-anthropogenic climate variations.

Stable carbon-isotope ratios of total organic carbon and terrestrial biomarkers from the lake sediments imply that the proportion of terrestrial plants using the C-4 photosynthetic pathway was greater during the Late Pleistocene than in the Holocene. Pollen data show that grasses were a major constituent of the vegetation throughout the Late Pleistocene and Holocene. The proportion of grass pollen relative to the pollen from other plants was greatest at the last glacial maximum (LGM).

Different human-mediated factors have affected different pine species in different ways in different regions. The most important factors affecting pine forests are altered fire regimes, altered grazing/browsing regimes, various harvesting/construction activities, land clearance and abandonment, purposeful planting and other manipulations of natural ecosystems, alteration of biotas through species reshuffling, and pollution. These changes are occurring against a backdrop of natural and anthropogenically driven climate change. We review past and current influence of humans in pine forests, seeking broad generalizations.

I used high-resolution macrofossil and lithological analyses of a fen peatland in western Canada to infer the Holocene developmental history of the peatland, to document the temporal pattern of long-term peat accumulation, and to investigate ecosystems responses to climate changes in terms of species composition and carbon accumulation. The peatland has been dominated by sedges and brown mosses during its 10,000-year history, despite interruption by tephra deposition. Peat accumulation rates vary by more than an order of magnitude and decline from 5500 to 1300 cal BP, resulting in a convex depth-age curve, which contrasts with the carbon accumulation patterns documented for oceanic peatlands. The synthesis of regional data from continental western Canada indicates that fens tend to accumulate more carbon than bogs of the same ages. These data suggest that the carbon sink potential of northern peatlands has varied dramatically in the past, so estimates of the present and projected carbon sink strengths of these peatlands need to take this temporal variation into consideration. Widespread slowdown of peat accumulation over the last 4000 years may have resulted from climate cooling in northern latitudes after the Holocene insolation maximum. The findings indicate that long-term peatland dynamics are modified by many local and regional factors and that gradual environmental change may be capable of triggering abrupt shifts and jumps in ecosystem states.","Lehigh Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA",,"Yu, ZC (corresponding author), Lehigh Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, 31 Williams Dr, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA.",ziy2@lehigh.edu,"Yu, Zicheng/D-4108-2012",,,,,40,60,62,1,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1432-9840,1435-0629,,ECOSYSTEMS,Ecosystems,DEC,2006,9,8,,,,,1278,1288,,10.1007/s10021-006-0174-2,,,11,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,128IS,WOS:000243652000006,,,,,2022-02-14

The logic of analogical inference involves a comparative element (comparison of modern and fossil assemblages to select matches and assess goodness of fit) and a causal element (assumption that the relationships between modern vegetation and derivative pollen assemblages are matched by those between ancient vegetation and fossil pollen assemblages). An array of numerical and statistical tools have been developed to ensure objective, consistent, and quantitative assessments of similarity between pollen assemblages. Divergent or convergent relationships between vegetation and pollen assemblages can arise from a variety of sources, composing a potential source of error in analog analysis, but such errors can be anticipated and minimized. Pollen assemblages lacking modern analogs are well documented for the late-glacial period (17,000-10,000 years BP) in eastern North America and other regions. Simulated climates for this period also lacked modern analogs owing to increased seasonality of insolation, lowered CO2, and persistent ice sheets. Most pollen assemblages from the last glacial maximum (23,000-20,000 years BP) in eastern North America have modern analogs, but macrofossil and other evidence suggest that the vegetation may have lacked modern analogs, owing to unique climate realizations and perhaps direct effects of lowered CO2. Better understanding of the nature of past no-analog vegetation, and the underlying causes, will address important issues in ecology and evolutionary biology and help anticipate biotic responses to the no-analog greenhouse world of the near-future.","Univ Wyoming, Dept Bot, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; Univ Minnesota, Dept Geol & Geophys, Limnol Res Ctr, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",,"Jackson, ST (corresponding author), Univ Wyoming, Dept Bot, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",jackson@uwyo.edu; willi477@umn.edu,,"Jackson, Stephen/0000-0002-1487-4652",,,,186,298,313,3,82,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",0084-6597,,,ANNU REV EARTH PL SC,Annu.

However, evaluation of the long-standing hypotheses about the region's environmental history has been hampered by the scarcity of palcorecords. We conducted multiproxy analyses on early and middle Holocene sediments from two Illinois, USA, lakes to assess long-term climatic, vegetational, and fire variability in the region. Sediment mineral composition, carbonate 8180, ostracode assemblages, and diatom assemblages were integrated to infer fluctuations in moisture availability. Pollen and charcoal delta C-13 were used to reconstruct vegetation composition, and charcoal influx was used to reconstruct fire. Results indicate that fire-sensitive trees (e.g., Ulmus, Ostrya, Fraxinus, and Acer saccharum) declined and prairie taxa expanded with increased aridity from 10 000 yr BP to 8500 yr BP. Between similar to 8500 yr BP and similar to 6200 yr BP, aridity declined, and prairie coexisted with fire-sensitive and fire-tolerant (e.g., Quercus and Carya) trees. After similar to 6200 yr BP, prairie taxa became dominant, although aridity was not more severe than it was around 8500 yr BP. Along with aridity, fire appears to have played an important role in the establishment and maintenance of prairie communities in the eastern Prairie Peninsula, consistent with the speculations of the early ecologists. Comparison of our data with results from elsewhere in the North American midcontinent indicates that spatial heterogeneity is a characteristic feature of climatic and vegetational variations on millennial time scales.","Univ Illinois, Program Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; Univ Illinois, Dept Geol, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; Illinois State Museum, Res & Collect Ctr, Springfield, IL 62703 USA; Illinois State Geol Survey, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; NE Illinois Univ, Dept Biol, Chicago, IL 60625 USA",,"Nelson, DM (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Program Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 265 Morrill Hall,505 S Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",dmnelson@life.uiuc.edu,"Grimm, Eric/G-3011-2013; Nelson, David M/D-5596-2009; Nelson, David/AAP-9412-2020","Nelson, David M/0000-0003-2755-5535; Nelson, David/0000-0003-2755-5535",,,,64,54,55,1,41,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,2006,87,10,,,,,2523,2536,,10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[2523:TIOAAF]2.0.CO;2,,,14,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,098XU,WOS:000241557900013,17089661,,,,2022-02-14

We show that plastid DNA is recoverable and usable from pollen grains of Scots pine Pinus sylvestris from 10 ka and 100 years ago. Comparison of the ancient sequences with modern sequences, obtained from an extant population, establish a first genetic link between modern and fossil samples of Scots pine, providing a genetic continuity through time. One common haplotype is present in each of the three periods investigated, suggesting that it persisted near the lake throughout the postglacial. The retrieval of aDNA from pollen has major implications for palaeoecology by allowing (i) investigation of population-level dynamics in time and space, and (ii) tracing ancestry of populations and developing phylogenetic trees that include extinct as well as extant taxa. The method should work over the last glacial oscillation, thus giving access to ancestry of populations over a crucial period of time for the understanding of the relationship between speciation and climate change.","Uppsala Univ, Geoctr, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden",,"Bennett, KD (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Geoctr, Villavagen 16, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.",keith.bennett@geo.uu.se,"Parducci, Laura/B-8918-2012; Bennett, Keith D/C-8619-2009; Parducci, Laura/H-9355-2019","Parducci, Laura/0000-0003-1956-4757; Bennett, Keith D/0000-0002-3423-1531; Parducci, Laura/0000-0003-1956-4757",,,,34,33,34,2,42,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0959-6836,1477-0911,,HOLOCENE,Holocene,DEC,2006,16,8,,,,,1031,1034,,10.1177/0959683606069383,,,4,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Physical Geography; Geology,127WP,WOS:000243617300001,,,,,2022-02-14

The sequences of insect assemblages date from the latter part of the Boiling to the end of the Allerod periods. Environmental analysis of these faunas shows that rivers with riffles and pools meandered across flood plains. The river was extensively fringed with reedy vegetation. The only trees growing close to the river were of Salix and/or Populus. All the insect assemblages indicate that the thermal climates during the Boiling and Allerod periods were similar to one another and during both periods were very nearly as warm as that of the present day. No insect fossils were recovered from the sediments attributed to the Older Dryas interval though other evidence from these sites suggests that this event was decidedly colder than those immediately preceding and succeeding it.

Using a fossil-pollen data set of over 700 sites, we review late-Quaternary vegetation history in northern and eastern North America across levels of ecological organization from individual taxa to biomes, and apply the insights gained from this review to critically examine the biome maps generated from the pollen data. Higher-order features of the vegetation (e.g., plant associations, physiognomy) emerge from individualistic responses of plant taxa to climate change, and different representations of vegetation history reveal different aspects of vegetation dynamics. Vegetation distribution and composition were relatively stable during full-glacial times (2100017 000 yr BP) [calendar years] and during the mid- to late Holocene (7000-500 yr BP), but changed rapidly during the late-glacial period and early Holocene (16000-.8000 yr BP) and after 500 yr BP Shifts in plant taxon distributions were characterized by individualistic changes in population abundances and ranges and included large east-west shifts in distribution in addition to the northward redistribution of most taxa. Modern associations such as Fagus-Tsuga and Picea-Alnus-Betula date to the early Holocene, whereas other associations common to the late-glacial period (e.g., Picea-Cyperaceae-Fraxinus-Ostrya/ Carpinus). no longer exist. Biomes are dynamic entities that have changed in distribution, composition; and structure over time. The late-Pleistocene suite of biomes is distinct from those that grew during the Holocene. The pollen-based biome reconstructions are able to capture the major features of late-Quaternary vegetation but downplay the magnitude and variety of vegetational responses to climate change by (1) limiting, apparent land-cover change to ecotones, (2) masking internal variations in biome composition, and (3) obscuring the range shifts and changes in abundance among individual taxa. The compositional and structural differences between full-glacial and recent biomes of the same type are. similar to or greater than the spatial heterogeneity in the composition and structure of present-day biomes. This spatial and temporal heterogeneity allows biome maps to accommodate individualistic behavior among species but masks climatically important variations in taxonomic composition as well as structural differences between modern biomes and their ancient counterparts.","Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA; Univ Oregon, Dept Geog, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; Brown Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA",,"Williams, JW (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Geol & Geophys, Limnol Res Ctr, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",willi477@umn.edu,"Bartlein, Patrick J./E-4643-2011","Bartlein, Patrick J./0000-0001-7657-5685; Shuman, Bryan/0000-0002-8149-8925",,,,144,389,395,3,146,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

The DJM population, a northern outpost of pinyon, was established by long-distance dispersal (similar to 40 km). Growth of this isolate was markedly episodic and tracked multidecadal variability in precipitation. Initial colonization occurred by AD 1246, but expansion was forestalled by catastrophic drought (1250-1288), which we speculate produced extensive mortality of Utah Juniper (Juniperus osteospemia (Torr.) Little), the dominant tree at DJM for the previous similar to 8700 years. Pinyon then quickly replaced juniper across DJM during a few wet decades (1330-1339 and 1368-1377). Such alternating decadal-scale droughts and pluvial events play a key role in structuring plant communities at the landscape to regional level. These decadal-length precipitation anomalies tend to be regionally coherent-and can synchronize physical and biological processes across large areas. Vegetation forecast models must incorporate these temporal and geographic aspects of climate variability to accurately predict the effects of future climate change.","US Geol Survey, Tucson, AZ 85745 USA; Univ Wyoming, Dept Bot, Laramie, WY 82071 USA",,"Gray, ST (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, 1675 W Anklam Rd, Tucson, AZ 85745 USA.",stgray@usgs.gov,,"Jackson, Stephen/0000-0002-1487-4652",,,,25,106,107,3,41,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAY,2006,87,5,,,,,1124,1130,,10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[1124:ROMCVI]2.0.CO;2,,,7,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,042TM,WOS:000237552400007,16761590,,,,2022-02-14

Aplodontids first appeared in the late Eocene, diversified during the early Oligocene, declined precipitously at the end of the Oligocene such that standing diversity was only about 5 species during the early Miocene, peaked again in the early middle Miocene, then declined through the late Miocene, and are entirely absent from the Pliocene and early Pleistocene fossil record. This long term pattern culminated in the survival of a single extant species, Aplodontia rufa, the mountain beaver. The species' richness and body size distribution through time were compared with the timing of climatic changes as inferred from global oxygen isotope curves, with the rise of grasslands as inferred from phytolith and other stable isotope studies, and with fluctuating diversity of potential competitors as inferred from published stratigraphic and geographic distributions. The timing of global climate change is decoupled from the diversity fluctuations and seems not to have been a proximate cause. Rise of grasslands and the increasing dominance Of C-4 vegetation correlates with diversity decline in the late Oligocene and late Miocene, but data are sparse, and more work will be required to determine the mechanism driving this relationship. Examination of potential mammalian competitors (sciurids and castorids) finds no evidence for competitive replacement of aplodontids. It is difficult to ascribe the fluctuations in aplodontid diversity to a single cause. The explanation likely involves vegetation changes associated with the spread of grasslands, but there is some variation in diversity that cannot be explained by the vegetation, at least using the proxies employed here. Climate and competition are less consistent with the available data. The reasons for the decline of aplodontids in the late Oligocene and the late Miocene apparently involved the interaction of multiple physical and biological causes, coupled with the chance events that underlie any evolutionary process.

The delta(13)C values of fossil enamel from a diverse group of herbivores and of paleosol carbonate and organic matter indicate that C4 grasses were either absent or insignificant in the Linxia Basin prior to similar to 2-3 Ma and only became a significant component of local ecosystems in the Quaternary. This is in striking contrast to what was observed in Pakistan, Nepal, Africa and the Americas where C4 plants expanded rapidly in the late Miocene as indicated by a positive delta(13)C shift in mammalian tooth enamel and paleosols. The delta(18)O results from the same herbivore species show several significant shifts in climate in the late Cenozoic. Most notably, a positive delta(18)O shift after similar to 7 Ma indicates a shift to warmer and/or drier conditions and is comparable in timing and direction to the delta(18)O shift observed in paleosol carbonates in Pakistan and Nepal. This late Miocene climate change observed in the Indian sub-continent and in the Linxia Basin, however, seems to be a regional manifestation of a global climate change. The lack of evidence for C4 plants in the Linxia Basin prior to similar to 2-3 Ma suggests that the East Asian summer monsoon, which brings precipitation into northern China during the summer and creates optimal conditions for the growth of C4 grasses, was probably not strong enough to affect this part of China throughout much of the Neogene. This implies that the Himalayan-Tibetan Plateau may not have reached the present-day elevation across its vast extent to support a strong East Asian monsoon system before similar to 2-3 Ma. Our data also suggest that regional climatic conditions played an important role in controlling the expansion of C4 plants. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Even before 15000 B.P. forest types became established which prove the existence in Central Nepal of a temperate-humid climate with a considerable amount of winter and spring precipitation from westerly disturbances. Lignin input and pollen data point to a patchy vegetation cover around Lake Rukche with meadow-steppes dominated by Poaceae. Around 15000 B.P. Quercus and Pinus roxburghii dominated the lower altitudes while the vegetation around Lake Rukche was more steppe-like (Chenopodiaceae, Artemisia). Subsequently the climate became warmer and drier as winter and spring precipitation decreased while summer rain remained low. Later on more resource-demanding forests became established under improved temperature and precipitation conditions (Engelhardia). Around Lake Rukche coniferous forests (Abies, Picea) occurred beside meadow-steppes. The transition from the Pleistocene to the Holocene is not recorded. In the Holocene alpine Kobresia-meadows stabilised the soil surface causing sand accumulation to end. During the mid-Holocene (7800-2750 B.P.) humid oak forests with demanding elements (Ilex, Coriaria, Myrsine and Engelhardia) dominated the vegetation cover. A charcoal layer and a marked emergence of fire-induced communities with Pinus roxburghii, Poaceae, Ericaceae and Pteridium are proofs of a first strong anthropogenic change in vegetation which coincided with the climatic deterioration at the onset of the Subatlantic. Since 900 B.P. grazing pressure and the frequency of fires increased, resulting in a replacement of Betula utilis-forests by meadows and woods of Juniperus and Rhododendron. While previous anthropogenic influence increased the biodiversity by promoting replacement communities, recent developments have led to a decrease in biodiversity through loss of natural vegetation communities.","Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, Dept Palynol & Quaternary Sci, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; Univ Bayreuth, Inst Soil Sci & Soil Geog, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany",,"Schlutz, F (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, Dept Palynol & Quaternary Sci, Wilhelm Weber Str 2, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",fschlue@gwdg.de,,"Schlutz, Frank/0000-0003-2114-8146",,,,59,19,19,1,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0939-6314,1617-6278,,VEG HIST ARCHAEOBOT,Veg.

Developing adaptive or causal perspectives on the morphological and behavioral variability documented in the human fossil record requires establishing a comprehensive paleoenvironmental context. Reconstructing environments in the past, however, is a complex undertaking, requiring assimilation of diverse datasets of varying quality, scale, and relevance. In response to these difficulties, human evolution has traditionally been interpreted in a somewhat generalized framework, characterized primarily by increasing aridity and seasonality periodically punctuated by pulses or intervals of environmental change, inferred largely from global climatic records. Although these broad paradigms provide useful heuristic approaches for interpreting human evolution, the spatio-temporal resolution remains far too coarse to develop unambiguous causal links. This challenge has become more acute as the emerging paleoenvironmental evidence from equatorial Africa is revealing a complex pattern of habitat heterogeneity and persistent ecological flux throughout the interval of human evolution. In addition, recent discoveries have revealed significant taxonomic diversity and substantially increased the geographic and temporal range of early hominids. These findings raise further questions regarding the role of the environment in mediating or directing the course of human evolution. As a consequence, it is imperative to critically assess the environmental criteria on which many theories and hypotheses of human evolution hinge. The goals here are to 1) compile, review, and evaluate relevant paleoecological datasets from equatorial Africa spanning the last 10 Ma, 2) develop a hierarchical perspective for developing and evaluating hypotheses linking paleoecology to patterns and processes in early hominid evolution, and 3) suggest a conceptual framework for modeling and interpreting environmental data relevant to human evolution in equatorial Africa.

The slab spans at least 62 years of deposition, determined from counting varves, and is dated at approximately 4400 years BP. The slab shows a sedimentation pattern where thick diatom-rich varves at the bottom become thinner and more silty toward the top. Thin section analysis reveals that the thicker varves contain a distinct succession of diatoms, representing seasonal deposition throughout each year. Annual-scale subsampling shows that the abundance of coastal marine diatoms, namely a weakly silicified form of Skeletonema costatum, decreased over the 62-year period, while benthic and brackish water diatoms, such as Planothidium delicatulum and Achnanthes minutissima, increased with the concomitant increase in silt. The increase in such benthic species and silt, along with the presence of similar to 1 cm thick nonlaminated intervals, is interpreted to represent deposition during progressively increasing precipitation over time. These sedimentation patterns and changes in diatom assemblages may signify a change in the relative intensities of the Aleutian Low (AL) and North Pacific High (NPH) atmospheric pressure systems. Thicker diatomaceous varves at the bottom of the slab reflect a stronger NPH system with associated coastal upwelling and enhanced diatom production. The thinner silty varves at the top of the slab suggest that the AL system was prevalent, resulting in greater amounts of precipitation and reduced upwelling. The findings of this study show that significant natural environmental change can occur within a twenty-year time frame, and can provide a basis for the study of modem change in the ocean-atmosphere system over the northeast Pacific Ocean.

Given the magnitude of forecasted trends, there are great concerns for the particularly rich biodiversity found in the region. Studies of the consequences of past climate shifts on biodiversity represent one of the best sources of data to validate models of the ecological and evolutionary consequences of future changes. Here we review recent findings from palaeoecology, phylogeography and climate change research to (1) explore possible antecedents of the predicted climate warming in the younger geological history of the Mediterranean Basin, (2) assess how tree populations have reacted to them, and (3) evaluate the significance of the evolutionary heritage that is at stake. A major question of our retrospective approach is whether Quaternary tree extinctions took place primarily during glacial or during interglacial episodes. Available data are scanty and somewhat conflicting. In contrast, abundant phylogeographic evidence clearly indicates that the bulk of genetic diversity in European temperate tree species is almost invariably located in the southernmost part of their range. Long-term persistence of isolated populations have been common phenomena in the Mediterranean, to the point that the current genetic structure in this area probably often reflects population divergence that pre-dates the onset of the Mediterranean climate in the Pliocene. In particular, Tertiary migrations into the Mediterranean of tree taxa originating from Asia seem to have left their footprints in the current genetic structure in these slowly evolving organisms. Moreover, phylogeographic studies point to heterogeneous rates of molecular evolution across lineages that are inversely related with their stability. We conclude that relict tree populations in the Mediterranean Basin represent an evolutionary heritage of disproportionate significance for the conservation of European plant biodiversity.","INRA, UMR Biodivers Genes & Ecosyst, F-33612 Cestas, France; CSIC, Estac Biol Donana, Integrat Ecol Grp, E-41080 Seville, Spain; Univ Montpellier 2, Inst Sci Evolut, F-34095 Montpellier, France",,"Petit, RJ (corresponding author), INRA, UMR Biodivers Genes & Ecosyst, 69 Route Arcachon, F-33612 Cestas, France.",petit@pierroton.inra.fr; arndt@ebd.csic.es; cheddadi@isem.univ-montp2.fr,"Petit, Remy/AAD-9078-2019; Petit, Rémy/A-8842-2008","Petit, Rémy/0000-0002-4809-1453; Hampe, Arndt/0000-0003-2551-9784",,,,66,188,192,1,56,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-0262,1996-8175,,TAXON,Taxon,NOV,2005,54,4,,,,,877,885,,10.2307/25065474,,,9,Plant Sciences; Evolutionary Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Plant Sciences; Evolutionary Biology,005HG,WOS:000234812600004,,,,,2022-02-14

These reconstructions were generated to provide a long-term perspective on drought in the Sierra Nevada. The sedimentary record is in agreement with other long-term records of climate and vegetation from the Sierra Nevada, and the records of climate and tire for the last c. 1000 years are in agreement with tree-ring and hydrological studies. This correspondence suggests that sedimentary charcoal and pollen are reliable indicators of change in climate, vegetation and fire frequency through time. The fire frequencies associated with the droughts of the 'Mediaeval Warm Period' are only half as great as those recorded during the early-Holocene insolation maximum. Model results suggest that the temperature increases associated with the insolation maximum are a good analogue for those expected with global warming. If this is the case, future droughts may be more severe than any experienced in the last several thousand years, and these data should be considered in planning for future change.","Univ Oregon, Dept Geog, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; No Arizona Univ, Ctr Environm Sci & Educ, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; No Arizona Univ, Quaternary Sci Program, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA",,"Brunelle, A (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Dept Geog, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",,,,,,,46,50,51,0,24,"ARNOLD, HODDER HEADLINE PLC",LONDON,"338 EUSTON ROAD, LONDON NW1 3BH, ENGLAND",0959-6836,,,HOLOCENE,Holocene,,2003,13,1,,,,,21,28,,10.1191/0959683603hl591rp,,,8,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Physical Geography; Geology,627KL,WOS:000179932300003,,,,,2022-02-14

An increasing number of phylogeographical studies in the Arctic have laid a framework for testing hypotheses concerning the impact of shifting environmental conditions on transcontinental movement. We review 35 phylogeographical studies of trans-Beringian terrestrial and freshwater taxa, both hosts and parasites, to identify generalized patterns regarding the number, direction and timing of trans-continental colonizations. We found that colonization across Beringia was primarily from Asia to North America, with many events occurring in the Quaternary period. The 35 molecular studies of trans-Beringian organisms we examined focused primarily on the role of glacial cycles and refugia in promoting diversification. We address the value of establishing testable hypotheses related to high-latitude biogeography. We then discuss future prospects in Beringia related to coalescent theory, palaeoecology, ancient DNA and synthetic studies of arctic host-parasite assemblages highlighting their cryptic diversity, biogeography and response to climate variation.","Idaho State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Pocatello, ID 83209 USA; USDA ARS, US Natl Parasite Collect, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA; Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias, Montevideo, Uruguay; Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; Univ New Mexico, Museum SW Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA",,"Waltari, E (corresponding author), Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, 79th St & Cent Pk W, New York, NY 10024 USA.",ewaltari@amnh.org,"Lessa, Enrique/D-8894-2011","Lessa, Enrique/0000-0001-9750-4093; Cook, Joseph/0000-0003-3985-0670; Waltari, Eric/0000-0001-6930-9645",,,,130,71,75,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-0270,1365-2699,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

An alternative model for land-use in a highland valley is developed using three high spatial -resolution pollen sequences from north-west Scotland. In spatial terms, land-use was shaped by the landscape but also structured to make the most productive use of the small, fragmented areas of better soil in a peat-dominated environment. Climate change alone provides an inadequate explanation for land-use dynamics. A combination of careful site selection, resource management, and social interactions buffered farmers from risks posed by upland conditions, whilst allowing the flexibility to respond to opportunities created by environmental and socio-economic change, particularly during the early Bronze Age, Bronze Age/Iron Age transition, Iron Age and 'Little Ice Age'. Implications for the perception of upland farming, for the prediction of responses to environmental risk, and for the expected character and survival of archaeological evidence for past upland and mountain-farming systems are evaluated.

Ungulate-vegetation interactions during the last 500 000 years were primarily driven by the climatic variation of the glacial-interglacial cycle. There were distinctive faunas associated with each temperate period and a loss of species diversity only in the present interglacial. Climate change and human activities have interacted during the most recent glacial cycle, accelerating extinction rates. This unique course of events has the consequence that no stable, 'base-line' conditions can be recognised. A review of the full-glacial 'mammoth-steppe' debate suggests that ungulate populations were limited by available forage, but a mosaic of habitat supported a diverse fauna in Beringia. In the debate over early-mid Holocene 'wood pasture', past ungulate populations are one of a range of disturbance factors, including burning, that influenced regional vegetation composition and structure in northern Europe. These debates concerning the scale and impacts of past ungulate-vegetation interactions will not be fully resolved until more is known about past ungulate population sizes. Modelling past scenarios would enhance the value of retrospective studies and help provide goals for management of near-natural ecosystems.

The environmental effects of this warm event are here documented based on stable isotopes and quantitative analysis of planktonic foraminifera, at the South Atlantic DSDP Site 525A. Stable isotopes of individual species mark a rapid increase in temperature and a reduction in the vertical water mass stratification that is accompanied by a decrease in niche habitats, reduced species diversity and/or abundance, smaller species morphologies or dwarfing, and reduced photosymbiotic activity. During the warm event, the relative abundance of a large number of species decreased, including tropical-subtropical affiliated species, whereas typical mid-latitude species retained high abundances. This indicates that climate warming did not create favorable conditions for all tropical-subtropical species at mid-latitudes and did not cause a massive retreat in the local mid-latitude population. A noticeable exception is the ecological generalist Heterohelix dentata Stenestad that dominated during the cool intervals, but significantly decreased during the warm event. However, dwarfing is the most striking response to the abrupt warming and occurred in various species of different morphologies and lineages (e.g. biserial, trochospiral, keeled globotruncanids). Dwarfing is a typical reaction to environmental stress conditions and was likely the result of increased reproduction rates. Similarly, photosymbiotic activity appears to have been reduced significantly during the maximum warming, as indicated by decreased delta(13)C values. The foraminiferal response to climate change is thus multifaceted resulting in decreased species diversity, decreased species populations, increased competition due to reduced niche habitats, dwarfing and reduced photosymbiotic activity.

When sedimentation resumed, a glacial foreland or super-puna flora is represented in which Polylepis was a significant element. Glacial outwash, marked by high sedimentary magnetic susceptibility, increased from c. 16,200 cat yr B.P. and reached a peak at c. 13,200 cat yr B.P. Between c. 12,500 cat yr B.P. and 10,000 cat yr B.P., magnetic susceptibility was reduced. Vegetation shifts suggest a cool dry time, consistent with regional descriptions of the Younger Dryas event. Deglaciation resumes by 10,000 cat yr B.P. and the last ice is lost from the catchnient at similar to 7500 cat yr B.P.

Alnus declined in abundance at 5500 cat yr B.P. when wetter and cooler conditions returned and human activity intensified. Maize (Zea mays) pollen first occurred in the core at similar to 2600 cat yr B.P., indicating a minimum age for local agriculture. An increase in Alnus pollen abundance at similar to 1000 cat yr B.P. could be due to human activity or perhaps due to a regional climate change associated with cultural turnover elsewhere in the Andes at this time.

We focus on the palaeoavifauna hunted by early Aleuts who inhabited Amchitka and Buldir islands (central Aleutians), and Shemya Island (western Aleutians) from c. 3500 yr ago to the present. Most of the seabird species recovered from these early sites varied widely in distribution and abundance through time and space. Pelagic procellariids such as short-tailed albatrosses and short-tailed shearwaters were present and abundant at most sites and at most times. During periods of increased temperatures and precipitation (e.g. 650-1100 yr BP), nearshore foragers such as cormorants and parakeet auklets increased in abundance, but during periods of cooling (e.g. 1800-2100 yr BP), piscivorous birds feeding offshore, such as murres and kittiwakes, predominated. Over three millennia, we found that marine bird populations were negatively correlated with temperature and positively correlated with precipitation. We detected hunter-related depletions of populations breeding in accessible colonies at small scales of space and time, but we did not observe widespread or long-term effects. We conclude that local oceanography and regional changes in prey bases caused by environmental and climate change in the past had a significant impact on the distribution and abundance of Aleutian marine birds.","Harvard Univ, Museum Comparat Zool, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ Alaska Anchorage, Dept Biol Sci, Anchorage, AK 99516 USA; US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Anchorage, AK 99503 USA; Museum Natl Hist Nat, Dept Ecol & Gest Biodivers, F-75231 Paris, France; CNRS, UMR 5197, Paris, France; Univ Kansas, Biodivers Res Ctr, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; Univ Kansas, Nat Hist Museum, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; Russian Acad Sci, AN Severtsov Inst Ecol & Evolut, Moscow 119071, Russia",,"Causey, D (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Museum Comparat Zool, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",dcausey@uaa.alaska.edu,"Khasanov, Bulat/Y-2371-2019; Savinetsky, Arkady B/A-5356-2016; Causey, Douglas/O-8584-2019; Lefèvre, Christine/AAV-1644-2021; Khasanov, Bulat/D-7300-2018; Causey, Douglas/A-1675-2009","Khasanov, Bulat/0000-0001-6535-9741; Causey, Douglas/0000-0002-4302-1771; Lefèvre, Christine/0000-0001-7388-559X; Khasanov, Bulat/0000-0001-6535-9741; Causey, Douglas/0000-0002-4302-1771",,,,116,29,29,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1054-6006,1365-2419,,FISH OCEANOGR,Fish Oceanogr.,NOV,2005,14,,,1,,,259,276,,10.1111/j.1365-2419.2005.00365.x,,,18,Fisheries; Oceanography,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Fisheries; Oceanography,968GG,WOS:000232149300017,,,,,2022-02-14

These settings have been implicated as the crucibles for life's origin, and as locales for methane release to the atmosphere from hydrate destabilization during past climate change. Ancient vent and seep deposits are also increasingly recognized, and occur in various sizes, lithologies, biotic compositions, geotectonic settings and ages. Precambrian vents were Populated with microbes, with the oldest metazoans in vent settings reported from possibly the Cambrian, but definitely by the Silurian. The oldest purported seep deposit with metazoan fossils is Silurian in age. A largely endemic and chemosymbiotic biota from modern vents and seeps appears distinct phylogenetically from those taxa in deposits older than Jurassic, with a shift from extant families of particular bivalves and gastropods to now-extinct family groups of brachiopods, monoplacophorans, bivalves and gastropods. An exception may be worm tubes of possible vestimentiferan origins, with a history in hydrothermal vent paleoenvironments extending back to the Early Paleozoic. Unfortunately their relatively simple morphology and particular style of preservation make comparisons with living groups a challenge. There may also be an ancient lineage of vent-seep restricted rhynchonellide brachiopods, which appears to have persisted in these settings from the Late Devonian through the Early Cretaceous. Because biotic components have changed in vent-seep settings through time, several lines of evidence must be marshaled to confirm the origin of suspected deposits in the geologic record. These include distinctive stable isotopic signatures of carbon, oxygen or sulfur in authigenic precipitates and/or tests of foraminiferans, certain mineral paragenetic sequences, and fluid-flow features. Lipid biomarkers also indicate biogeochernical cycling by Archaea and Bacteria, which performed sulfate-dependent, anaerobic oxidation of methane in ancient marine sediments. The origin of an endemic modem vent-seep biota has been attributed to either enhanced accumulation of Paleozoic and Mesozoic relies, or migration of various invertebrate groups into vent and seep environments during the Phanerozoic. Current databases from fossils and molecular characterization of living groups suggest that adaptive radiations and extinctions have occurred, with a range of lineage-ages represented. Fossil and molecular data broadly coincide with respect to the Cretaceous origination of vesicomyid bivalves and neomphaline gastropods in vents and seeps, but the data sets appear discordant at present for vestimentiferan tubeworms and bathymodiolin bivalves. Paleobiogeographic patterns are just beginning to emerge front Studies of vent and seep fossils, and are likely to reflect past plate tectonic configurations, sea-level change, as well as the history of organic matter accumulation, burial, hydrocarbon generation, and fluid migration with time. Thus far, ancient hydrocarbon seep deposits yield more diverse fossils than hydrothermal vent deposits, the opposite of the global diversity recently tabulated for modern vent-seep species. However, in the fossil record, taphonomic processes negatively impacted on ancient vent organisms, and the number of known ancient vent systems is still relatively small compared to regional occurrences of ancient seep deposits. Future research will likely investigate many new/suspected sites, inventory numerous additional taxa, decipher underlying Causes of variability among settings, and mobilize biologists and geologists to, work together to solve problems that cross both disciplines.

Using GIS techniques, the changing configuration and bathymetry of Lake of the Woods in Ontario, Manitoba, and Minnesota were reconstructed for 12 points in time, beginning at 11,000 cal yr B. P. (similar to 9.6 C-14 ka B. P.), and were also projected 500 years into the future, based on the assumption that Lake of the Woods continued to have a positive hydrological budget throughout the Holocene. This modeling was done by first compiling a bathymetric database and merging that with subaerial data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). This DEM. le was then adjusted by: (1) isobase data derived from Lake Agassiz beaches prior to 9000 cal yr B. P. (similar to 8.1 C-14 ka B. P.) and (2) modeled isostatic rebound trend analysis after 9000 cal yr B. P. Just after the end of the Lake Agassiz phase of Lake of the Woods, only the northernmost part of the basin contained water. Differential rebound has resulted in increasing water depth. In the first 3000 years of independence from Lake Agassiz, the lake transgressed > 50 km to the south, expanding its area from 858 to 2857 km 2, and more than doubling in volume. Continued differential rebound after 6000 cal yr B. P. (similar to 5.2 14 C ka B. P.) has further expanded the lake, although today it is deepening by only a few cm per century at the southern end. In addition, climate change in the Holocene probably played a role in lake level fluctuations. Based on our calculation of a modern hydrological budget for Lake of the Woods, reducing runoff and precipitation by 65% and increasing evaporation from the lake by 40% would end overflow and cause the level of the lake to fall below the outlets at Kenora. Because this climate change is comparable to that recorded during the mid- Holocene warming across the region, it is likely that the area covered by the lake at this time would have been less than that determined from differential isostatic rebound alone.","Univ Manitoba, Dept Geol Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada; Hunan Normal Univ, Dept Geog, Changsha 410006, Hunan, Peoples R China",,"Yang, ZR (corresponding author), Univ Manitoba, Dept Geol Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada.",yangz0@cc.umanitoba.ca,,,,,,48,22,24,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-2728,1573-0417,,J PALEOLIMNOL,J.

Conditions altered during the late Holocene, with loss of woody vegetation and increasing erosion: trends that were initiated prior to human settlement. AMS dating of sub-fossil Betula, Salix and Juniperus found buried in peat profiles from the islands of Suouroy, Sandoy, Eysturoy, Vagar and Streymoy, revealed that the islands had at least partial woody vegetation cover up to the time of continuous settlement. The settlement horizon, identified in a lacustrine sequence on the island of Eysturoy, dated to c. AD 570. It comprised pollen evidence for the cultivation of Hordeum, cultural macrofossil assemblages, charcoal fragments, diatom assemblage changes indicating lake nutrient enrichment and physical measurements showing increased sedimentation rates. The pollen record showed that heathland development was initiated prior to anthropogenic impact. The ecosystem impacts of settlement were therefore superimposed on landscape changes that began around AD 250. The earlier changes were most likely forced by increased storminess and declining atmospheric temperatures.","Swedish Univ Agr Sci, So Swedish Forest Res Ctr, S-23053 Alnarp, Sweden; Geol Survey Denmark & Greenland, Dept Quaternary Geol, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark; Lund Univ, Dept Geol Quaternary Sci, GeoBiosphere Sci Ctr, S-22362 Lund, Sweden; Univ Stockholm, Dept Phys Geog & Quaternary Geol, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",,"Hannon, GE (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, So Swedish Forest Res Ctr, Box 49, S-23053 Alnarp, Sweden.",Gina.Hannon@ess.slu.se,"Wastegard, Stefan/G-5720-2012; Bradshaw, Richard HW/H-8663-2013","Bradshaw, Richard HW/0000-0002-7331-2246; Snowball, Ian/0000-0002-6257-3088",,,,44,29,29,1,24,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0959-6836,1477-0911,,HOLOCENE,Holocene,JUL,2005,15,5,,,,,639,647,,10.1191/0959683605hl840rp,,,9,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Physical Geography; Geology,949AU,WOS:000230758100001,,,,,2022-02-14

The Allerod woodland dominated by Pinus sylvestris became more open at the beginning of the Younger Dryas, when aeolian (wind) activity resulted in instability of the soil. During the early phase of the Younger Dryas the water level in the local basin distinctly raised, indicating a change to a wetter climate. This short-lasting phase was followed by an increased frequency and intensity of aeolian processes. However, the main aeolian event took place before the major expansion of Juniperus, not later than 10,780 +/- 120 B.P. Frequent woodland fires, probably due to the activities of Palaeolithic people, have been documented both for the Allerod and the Younger Dryas periods. Macrofossils of Alnus sp. found in the Allerod layer are of special interest in showing the presence of alder trees in northwest Poland as early as the Late-glacial.","Univ Gdansk, Dept Plant Ecol, Lab Palaeoecol & Archaeobot, PL-80441 Gdansk, Poland; Univ Szczecin, Marine Res Inst, Dept Geol & Palaeogeog, PL-71412 Szczecin, Poland",,"Latalowa, M (corresponding author), Univ Gdansk, Dept Plant Ecol, Lab Palaeoecol & Archaeobot, Al Legionow 9, PL-80441 Gdansk, Poland.",bioml@univ.gda.pl; krzysztof_borowka@univ.szczecin.pl,,"Latalowa, Malgorzata/0000-0001-7594-5146",,,,79,19,20,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0939-6314,1617-6278,,VEG HIST ARCHAEOBOT,Veg.

By analyzing 0.5-cm layers of a lake sediment we reached a temporal resolution of 44 years, and we were able to reconstruct vegetation changes in the surrounding area at species level. The sedimentary record analyzed extends from the Late-Glacial to the late Holocene. Alpine grasslands (12'000-11'000 cal.

Changes in the abundance of P cembra and L. decidua needles as well as changes of the other taxa were consistent with those found in previous studies from the same lake.

Together with palaeobotanical investigations (pollen and macro remains) and the archaeological results (trackway) the dendroecological analysis mirrors environmental changes and the response of people to these changes. In order to test this local development for a possible climate background, ring-width variability and population dynamics of the Campemoor pines and of the overall data set of Lower Saxonian sub-fossil oaks from bogs have been compared. The results of these investigations clearly indicate a common widespread turn from drier to more humid climate conditions as trigger for the transition period, initiating the raised bog growth. It happened in two phases at the beginning of the 3rd millennium, interrupted by a drier period between 2825 and 2770 B.C.

Cold-water adapted taxa indicate a cold climate. During the early Holocene, from about 9500 to 7700 conventional radiocarbon yr BP, climate improvement is marked by an increase in warm-water adapted taxa and a decrease in cold-water fauna. However, the cold-water fauna persist, probably because of both the instability and continentality of the climate. During the mid Holocene, from about 7700 to 6000 BP, the marine transgression strongly influenced the river's hydrological regime and consequently the chironomid assemblages. At that time, eutrophic, warm and shallow stagnant-water conditions occured throughout the basin. From 6000 to 3200 BR the St-Momelin basin was subjected to a marine regression. Chironomids indicate a hydrological regime marked by an alternance of phases with either a dominance of rheophilous or limnophilous fauna.

Pinus-dominated vegetation and a cool and moist climate prevailed in the early phase of the Lateglacial. Later stages of the Lateglacial were characterised by a mixed coniferous forest with Tsuga species, Picea and Abies and slightly warmer conditions and increased moisture. Alnus, Picea and Pteridium aquilinum dominated the vegetation of the early Holocene. Warmer and drier conditions prevailed during this phase. Increased moisture and decreased temperatures characterised the mid-Holocene as indicated by the dominance of Cupressaceae, Tsuga heterophylla, Alnus and Picea in the forest around the study site. This represented a transitional stage to the late-Holocene Cupressaceae-T heterophylla phase, when the modem climate regime characterised by temperate and wet conditions became established. The vegetation succession identified correlates well with Lateglacial and Holocene records from other sites in the Coastal Western Hemlock biogeoclimatic zone of British Columbia.

In the South Carpathians, diverse and well preserved floras have been recorded since the middle of the 19th Century in the Resita, Sirinia, Presacina, Cerna-Jiu, Holbav and Cristian Basins. The ages of these floras range between Hettangian and Sinemurian, with representatives belonging to Bryophytes, Pteridophytes and Gymnosperms. Excellent preservation and diversity were recorded in Anina, in the central area of the Resita Basin, a possible fossile-Lagerstatte locality. The 3D collecting opportunities due to underground coal mining permitted detailed phytostratigraphical studies. These studies showed a floral change at the Hettangian-Sinemurian boundary, related to climate change. The Jurassic coat basins of the South Carpathians show both intramontainous and paralic features. The Resita Basin is a typical intramountainous depression basin, while the other basins are influenced by the marine realm. From a paleogeographical point of view, the Romanian Early and Middle Jurassic floras occurred on the northern frame of the Tethys realm, floristic features indicating the Eurosinian Province. One of the closest floras in terms of floristic similarities is the Iranian Early Jurassic flora. In the Apuseni Mountains, the Hettangian-Sinemurian flora is less well-preserved and diverse than those of the South Carpathians. The Middle Jurassic flora of Romania is confined to Dobrogea (Eastern Romania), where a bennettite-dominated assemblage with low diversity and preservation was recorded.","Univ Bucharest, Fac Geol & Geophys, Lab Palaeontol, Bucharest, Romania; Natl Nat Hist Museum Naturalis, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands",,"Popa, ME (corresponding author), Univ Bucharest, Fac Geol & Geophys, Lab Palaeontol, Bucharest, Romania.",mihai@mepopa.com,"Popa, Mihai Emilian/A-1212-2008","Popa, Mihai Emilian/0000-0003-2163-3758",,,,87,24,27,1,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1002-0071,,,PROG NAT SCI,Prog.

Lily Lake is on the southwestern end of the main island of Isle Royale surrounded by northern hardwoods forest. Lake Ojibway is on the northeastern end of the main island surrounded by boreal forest. Pollen and spore records were analyzed using pollen percentage diagrams, nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination, and modern analog analysis. Squared chord distances for temporally paired subsamples from each site were calculated to determine palynological dissimilarities between the sites through time. These analyses revealed an overall vegetation history that is consistent with other regional reconstructions. High percentages of spruce pollen, indicating a cool climate, are present in the early Holocene, whereas high percentages of pine pollen, indicating a dry climate, occur in the mid-Holocene. The pollen records from the two sites diverge with increased precipitation during the late Holocene. At this time, birch-dominated forest is established near Lily Lake on till-derived soils. At Lake Ojibway, a mixed birch, pine, spruce, and fir forest is established on bedrock-derived soils. The divergence in forest composition is most pronounced within the last 500 years, and this divergence is tentatively attributed to the response of taxa on different substrates to increasing precipitation. Other possible explanations for the recent divergence include changing microclimates or disturbance regimes.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN 55108 USA",,"Flakne, R (corresponding author), Glen Redev Project, Village Glenview,1370 Shermer Rd, Glenview, IL 60025 USA.",rflakne@glenview.il.us,,,,,,88,8,8,1,7,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0045-5067,1208-6037,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

The rationale for such an approach is that management to favour landscape compositions and stand structures similar to those of natural ecosystems should also maintain biological diversity and essential ecological functions. In fire-dominated landscapes, this approach is possible only if current and future fire frequencies are sufficiently low, in comparison to pre-industrial fire frequency, that we can substitute fire with forest management. I address this question by comparing current and future fire frequency to historical reconstruction of fire frequency from studies in the Canadian boreal forest. Current and simulated future fire frequencies using 2x and 3x CO2 scenarios are lower than the historical fire frequency for most sites, suggesting that forest management could potentially be used to recreate the forest age structure of fire-controlled pre-industrial landscapes. Current even-aged management, however, tends to reduce forest variability: for example, fully regulated, even-aged management will tend to truncate the natural forest stand age distribution and eliminate overmature and old-growth forests from the landscape. The development of silvicultural techniques that maintain a spectrum of forest compositions and structures at different scales in the landscape is one avenue to maintain this variability.","UQAT, UQAM, CRSNG, Chaire Ind Amenagement Forestier Durable, Rouyn Noranda, PQ J9X 5E4, Canada",,"Bergeron, Y (corresponding author), UQAT, UQAM, CRSNG, Chaire Ind Amenagement Forestier Durable, CP 700, Rouyn Noranda, PQ J9X 5E4, Canada.",yves.bergeron@uqat.ca,,,,,,27,29,29,0,11,CANADIAN INST FORESTRY,MATTAWA,"C/O CANADIAN ECOLOGY CENTRE, PO BOX 430, 6905 HWY 17 W, MATTAWA, ONTARIO P0H 1V0, CANADA",0015-7546,1499-9315,,FOREST CHRON,For.

Difficulties exist in assessing these, largely because the evidence from many rivers remains limited and fragmentary. Here we address this issue in the context of the river Kennet, a tributary of the Thames, since c. 13,000 cal BP. Some similarities with other rivers are present, suggesting that regional climatic shifts are important controls. The Kennet differs from the regional pattern in a number of ways. The rate of response to sudden climatic change, particularly at the start of the Holocene and also mid-Holocene forest clearance, appears very high. This may reflect abrupt shifts between two catchment scale hydrological states arising from contemporary climates, land use change and geology. Stadial hydrology is dominated by nival regimes, with limited winter infiltration and high spring and summer runoff. Under an interglacial climate, infiltration is more significant. The probable absence of permafrost in the catchment means that a lag between the two states due to its gradual decay is unlikely. Palaeoecology, supported by radiocarbon dates, suggests that, at the very start of the Holocene, a dramatic episode of fine sediment deposition across most of the valley floor occurred, lasting 500-1000 years. A phase of peat accumulation followed as mineral sediment supply declined. A further shift led to tufa deposition, initially in small pools, then across the whole floodplain area, with the river flowing through channels cut in tufa and experiencing repeated avulsion. Major floods, leaving large gravel bars that still form positive relief features on the floodplain, followed mid-Holocene floodplain stability. Prehistoric deforestation is likely to be the cause of this flooding, inducing a major environmental shift with significantly increased surface runoff. Since the Bronze Age, predominantly fine sediments were deposited along the valley with apparently stable channels and vertical floodplain accretion associated with soil erosion and less catastrophic flooding. The Kennet demonstrates that, while a general pattern of river behaviour over time, within a region, may be identifiable, individual rivers are likely to diverge from this. Consequently, it is essential to understand catchment controls, particularly the relative significance of surface and subsurface hydrology. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Although climate change has been invoked to explain these fluctuations, its role is still in debate. Here, we reconstruct water balance by employing peat samples collected from swale deposits present between beach ridge sequences at two locations along the coastline of Lake Superior. Carbon isotope ratios for Sphagnum remains from these peat deposits are used as a proxy for water balance because the presence or absence of water films on Sphagnum controls the overall isotope discrimination effects. Consequently, increased average water content in Sphagnum produces elevated delta C-13 values. Two maxima of Sphagnum delta C-13 values interpreted to reflect wetter conditions prevailed from 3400 to 2400 cat BP and from about 1900 to 1400 cat BP. There are two relatively short drier periods as inferred from low Sphagnum delta C-13 values: one is centered at about 2300 cat BP, and one begins at 1400 cat BP. A good covariance was found between Sphagnum delta C-13 values and reconstructed lake-levels for Lake Michigan in which elevated carbon isotope values correlate well with higher lake levels. Based on this covariance, we conclude that climate exerts a strong influence on lake levels in Lake Superior for the past 4000 cat BP. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite this long history, there has been little discussion of how model parameters may be estimated from real paleontological data. In this paper, I outline a likelihood-based framework for fitting and comparing models of phyletic evolution. Because of its usefulness and historical importance, I focus on a general form of the random walk model. The long-term dynamics of this model depend on just two parameters: the mean (mu(step)) and variance (sigma(2)(step)) of the distribution of evolutionary transitions (or steps). The value of (mu(step)) determines the directionality of a sequence, and sigma(2)(step) governs its volatility. Simulations show that these two parameters can be inferred reliably from paleontological data regardless of how completely the evolving lineage is sampled. In addition to random walk models, suitable modification of the likelihood function permits consideration of a wide range of alternative evolutionary models. Candidate evolutionary models may be compared on equal footing using information statistics such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Two extensions to this method are developed: modeling stasis as an evolutionary mode, and assessing the homogeneity of dynamics across multiple evolutionary sequences. Within this framework, I reanalyze two well-known published data sets: tooth measurements from the Eocene mammal Cantius, and shell shape in the planktonic foraminifera Contusotruncana. These analyses support previous interpretations about evolutionary mode in size and shape variables in Cantius, and confirm the significantly directional nature of shell shape evolution in Contusotruncana. In addition, this model-fitting approach leads to a further insight about the geographic structure of evolutionary change in this foraminiferan lineage.","Smithsonian Inst, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Dept Paleobiol, Washington, DC 20013 USA",,"Hunt, G (corresponding author), Smithsonian Inst, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Dept Paleobiol, Washington, DC 20013 USA.",hunte@si.edu,"Hunt, Gene/B-3783-2010","Hunt, Gene/0000-0001-6430-5020",,,,57,140,143,0,34,PALEONTOLOGICAL SOC INC,LAWRENCE,"810 EAST 10TH ST, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA",0094-8373,,,PALEOBIOLOGY,Paleobiology,FAL,2006,32,4,,,,,578,601,,10.1666/05070.1,,,24,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Paleontology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Paleontology,105NP,WOS:000242037500004,,,,,2022-02-14

The available hypotheses are difficult to test robustly, however, because there are few detailed palaeoclimatic records in the Southern Hemisphere. Here we present climatic reconstructions from the southwestern Pacific, a key region in the Southern Hemisphere because of the potentially important role it plays in global climate change. The reconstructions for the period 20-10 kyr BP were obtained from five sites along a transect from southern New Zealand, through Australia to Indonesia, supported by 125 calibrated C-14 ages. Two periods of significant climatic change can be identified across the region at around 17 and 14.2 cal kyr BP, most probably associated with the onset of warming in the West Pacific Warm Pool and the collapse of Antarctic ice during Meltwater Pulse-1A, respectively. The severe geochronological constraints that inherently afflict age models based on radiocarbon dating and the lack of quantified climatic parameters make more detailed interpretations problematic, however. There is an urgent need to address the geochronological limitations, and to develop more precise and quantified estimates of the pronounced climate variations that clearly affected this region during the Last Termination.

Hydrogen isotope ratios (H-2/H-1, measured as delta D) of bison bone collagen should ultimately reflect, through bison diet, those average ratios of local precipitation, which vary systematically according to location and climate. To confirm this, delta D values were measured from bone collagen samples collected from geographically distinct populations of modem bison in North America. The delta D values of these goups differed in a manner consistent with that of the modem isotopic and climate gradients at each geographic location. Archaeological bison bone samples representing eight temporally distinct populations covering Early, Middle and Late prehistoric age sites from southern Saskatchewan were collected and analyzed. While the mean delta D value of each group was consistent with variations in hydrogen isotope composition observable from precipitation in the northern plains, significant differences were found between some of the sampled cohorts. These differences represent climate differences at each of the sampled time periods. The temporal climatic patterns revealed by the delta D values of prehistoric bison population bone collagen compares favourably with other models of southern Saskatchewan Holocene climate change as reconstructed using other proxy climate archives.

Palynological evidence suggests that during the early Holocene, Eagle Lake was surrounded by an open forest. The pollen assemblage indicates that climatic conditions were warmer and drier than at present with high alder pollen values. Spruce and fir were common in local forests throughout the Holocene. Western hemlock pollen first occurs at approximately 3500 C-14 years BP. The migration path of western hemlock into this region is currently unclear. Data from palynological records appear insufficient to resolve the migration pattern, although several routes are possible. The available data support northward migration into southeastern British Columbia. The arrival of this conifer may be in response to the late Holocene increase in precipitation, as inferred from many lower elevation and coastal sites: Mountain hemlock pollen does not appear until about 2100 C-14 years BP. Mountain hemlock's migration route into southeastern British Columbia is also unresolved. In the late Holocene, the presence of mountain hemlock, and increases of Ericales and valeriana sitchensis pollen, suggest a shift to the more open, cool, and moist conditions characteristic of the modern-day subalpine parkland. These climatic inferences correspond closely to those derived from other palynological and geological evidence throughout southern British Columbia.","Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; Okanagan Univ Coll, Dept Biol, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada",,"Rosenberg, SM (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",smrosenb@sfu.ca,,"MATHEWES, ROLF/0000-0001-7637-199X",,,,71,17,17,0,4,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0008-4026,,,CAN J BOT,Can.

The aim of the project was to analyse possible links between climate, lithology, and vegetation development. The section in Ze'elim shows both lacustrine and fluvial sediments, whereas sedimentation at Ein Feshkha is predominantly lacustrine. The Ze'elim profile, previously used for paleo-lake reconstruction provides an opportunity to compare climate triggered lake levels as paleo-hydrological indicators and vegetation history by use of palynology. The vegetation development in Ze'elim and Fin Feshkha is influenced by both climate and human impact. The pollen record of Ze'elim begins in the Pottery Neolithic, the section of Ein Feshkha in the Late Bronze Age. both records end in the Middle Ages. The Ze'elim section is characterized by sedimentary hiati between the beginning of the Chalcolithic Period until the Middle Bronze Age and within the Late Bronze Age. Settlement periods during the Middle Bronze Age, Iron Age and Hellenistic-Roman-Byzantine Period are indicated by high values of anthropogenic indicators and/or Mediterranean trees. Collapses of agriculture, which can be related to climate effects, are evident during the Late Bronze Age, during the Iron Age and at the end of the Byzantine Period when the lake level curve indicates and conditions. A comparison of the two pollen records, from different environments, illustrates a more prominent influence of Mediterranean vegetation and cultivated plants in the pollen diagram of Ein Feshkha. The southern Dead Sea region (at the desert fringe) is more vulnerable to regional climate change. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

It has been proposed that human actions degrade system resilience, thus allowing state changes to occur more easily. Unless system dynamics in the absence of human influence are understood, however, we can not address two fundamental questions: are human actions producing dynamics that were previously absent in those systems? Or, are human actions simply replacing natural drivers of change in systems susceptible to state shifts? I use fossil pollen and charcoal to document Holocene vegetation and disturbance dynamics on a sand plain in Michigan to evaluate a recent anthropogenic state shift from forest to a barrens plant community. A 10 500-yr pollen record shows that a community similar to the modern barrens was present three times between 9000 and 5000 yr BP. These periods coincide with distinct peaks in the charcoal record, linking the barrens vegetation community and fire. The barrens vegetation community is thus a rare component of the Kingston Plain system, associated with both natural and anthropogenic disturbances. However, with no evidence of barrens vegetation during the last 5000 years, it appears that climate is also an important driver of vegetation change on the Kingston Plain. Ancient barrens occurred when annual precipitation was lower than current climate, and summer temperatures were warmer than current climate. Projections of decreased soil moisture and warmer temperatures in the Great Lakes region during the next century may thus imply decreased resilience of Great Lakes forests to future disturbances.","US Forest Serv, N Cent Res Stn, USDA, Grand Rapids, MN 55744 USA",,"Lytle, DE (corresponding author), US Forest Serv, N Cent Res Stn, USDA, 1831 Highway 169 E, Grand Rapids, MN 55744 USA.",dlytle@fs.fed.us,,,,,,80,12,12,0,27,"ARNOLD, HODDER HEADLINE PLC",LONDON,"338 EUSTON ROAD, LONDON NW1 3BH, ENGLAND",0959-6836,,,HOLOCENE,Holocene,NOV,2005,15,6,,,,,821,836,,10.1191/0959683605hl856ra,,,16,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Physical Geography; Geology,959OQ,WOS:000231527900005,,,,,2022-02-14

The mire followed the classical Succession from lake to a Sphagnum-dominated peatland, but peat accumulation only started about 3000 cal. BP. A rapid shift to wetter conditions, lower pH and higher peat accumulation rate took place about 110-150 years before present, when the vegetation shifted to a Sphagnum-dominated poor fen with sonic bog plants. While the first shift to a peat-accumulating system was most likely driven by climate, the second one was probably caused by forest clearance around the mire. This shift towards a Sphagnum-dominated vegetation mirrors both in pattern and timing the changes observed in similar situations in North America and New Zealand. While human activities have overall caused the loss of vast expanses of peatlands worldwide in recent Centuries. locally they may have also allowed the development Of communities that are now ironically considered to have a high conservation value. However, in the case of the site studied the likely anthropogenic shift to bog vegetation was at the expense of a species-rich poor fen, which today has even higher conservation value than ombrotrophic bogs. Thus this study also illustrates the value of palaeoecology for peatland management and biodiversity conservation.","[Lamentowicz, Mariusz; Tobolski, Kazimierz] Adam Mickiewicz Univ Poznan, Dept Biogeog & Palaeoecol, PL-61680 Poznan, Poland; [Mitchell, Edward A.

To evaluate this potential, we examined charcoal records in Pb-210-dated cores from 12 small hollows and looked for evidence of 20 local fires reconstructed with tree-ring records from the surrounding forest. Using all charcoal >0.15 mm wide we established an optimum threshold that identified charcoal peaks corresponding to known fires while minimizing charcoal peaks identified that were not associated with known fires (i.e., false positives). This threshold detected four of four high-severity fires, five of 10 moderate-severity fires, and three of six low-severity fires. Analysis of larger charcoal alone (>0.50 mm wide) yielded nearly identical temporal patterns and detection rates, but four false positives were identified, twice as many as identified using all charcoal >0.15 mm wide. Charcoal peak magnitude was highly variable within severity classes: although half of the low- and moderate-severity fires left no detectable peaks, others left peaks larger than some high-severity fires. Our results suggest that fire detection depends strongly on fire severity and that fine-scale spatial patterns of lower-severity burns play an important role in determining the charcoal signature of these events. High detection rates for high-severity fires and low false-positive rates indicate that charcoal records from small hollows will be most useful in systems where fires are large, severe and infrequent.","Univ Washington, Coll Forest Resources, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",,"Higuera, PE (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Coll Forest Resources, Box 352100, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",phiguera@u.washington.edu,"Higuera, Philip Edward/B-1330-2010","Higuera, Philip Edward/0000-0001-5396-9956",,,,61,113,114,0,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0959-6836,1477-0911,,HOLOCENE,Holocene,FEB,2005,15,2,,,,,238,251,,10.1191/0959683605hl789rp,,,14,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Physical Geography; Geology,907QQ,WOS:000227733400007,,,,,2022-02-14

These cores reveal a history of subtle environmental change that began with the formation of Lago Tapajos as sea level rose about 11,000 years ago. The sediments of the lake were deposited fairly quickly-at a rate of ca. 4 m per millennium and are uniformly fine grained, with low organic content. The fossil pollen record derived from these sediments reveals that forest surrounded this site throughout the Holocene. The largest change in the core took place between ca. 5500 and 4200 cal. years BP and reflects a transition from coarser to finer sediments. Coincident with the change in sediment is a slight transition in the pollen spectra with an increase in Poaceae abundance at the expense of the pioneer tree Cecropia cecropia. A tentative explanation is offered in which increased human activity, possibly spurred by climatic change, resulted in the formation of some local grasslands. However, despite the apparent actions of humans, there is no indication of basin-wide transformation of landscapes in this record. The Holocene persistence of forest as the dominant landscape matrix around Lago Tapajos is supported by low delta C-13 values and by the constant geochemistry and mineralogy of the lake sediments.

Paleosols, regional groundwater tables, abiotic proxy data and pollen of aquatic plants in lake sediments.; show a marked and rapid shift from very humid late-glacial/early Holocene climatic conditions (between ca. 14 and 9.5 kyr B.P.) to extremely dry mid-Holocene conditions (more and than today between ca. 9 and 4 kyr B.P.). An exception during this hyperarid period is a century-scale more humid interval around ca. 5.5-6 kyr B.P. that appears systematically in lake sediment archives. In contrast, pollen for most terrestrial plants preserved in lake sediments do not show major changes during the Holocene, whereas more humid mid-Holocene conditions (compared with late Holocene conditions) were inferred from plant macrofossils in rodent middens. Is the reason for.. this disagreement to be attributed to misinterpretation of the paleoenvironments or of the proxy records themselves', or to incomplete paleoclimatic interpretation of the paleoenvironments? We argue that these different paleoclimate archives record different aspects and facets of 'climate'. While paleosols and groundwater in the Atacama Desert record low-frequency climate variability at century to millennium scales, lake sediments on the Altiplano record decade- to century-scale variability. Terrestrial vegetation responds to shorter high-frequency climate variability at seasonal to, inter-annual scales and preferably to humid years. Vegetation remains in 'hibernation' or does not germinate during and years. Thus information from these three types of archives is not a priori comparable and requires careful site-specific, archive-specific and time-scale-specific evaluation. What is natural in modem climatology is also true for paleoclimatology: a comprehensive assessment must account for the complex daily and seasonal cycles, for the range of climate variability and trends at different scales in space and time, for impacts of short-term extreme events, and for specific, often non-linear responses of individual bio-geo-physical archives to any of the numerous aspects of 'climate'.

To determine the historical role of fire on western Vancouver Island (British Columbia, Canada), we constructed a long-term spatially explicit fire history and examined the spatial and temporal distribution of fire during the Holocene. Two fire-history parameters (time-since-fire [TSF] and fire extent) were related to three landscape parameters landform [hill slope or terrace]. aspect, and forest composition) at 83 sites in a 730-ha low-elevation (less than similar to200 m) area of a mountainous watershed. We dated fires using tree rings ( 18 sites) and 120 soil-charcoal radiocarbon dates (65 sites). Comparisons among multiple radiocarbon dates indicated a high probability that the charcoal dated at each site represented the most recent fire, though we expect greater error in TSF estimates at sites where charcoal was very old (>6000 yr) and was restricted to mineral soil horizons. TSF estimates ranged from 64 to similar to12 220 yr; 45% of the sites have burned in the last 1000 yr, whereas 2017( of the sites have not burned for over 6000 yr. Differences in median TSF were more significant between landform types or across aspects than among forest types, Median TSF was significantly greater on terraces (4410 yr) than on hill slopes (740 yr). On hill slopes. all south-facing and southwest-facing sites have burned within the last 1000 yr compared to only 27% of north- and east-facing sites burning over the same period. Comparison of fire dates among neighboring sites indicated that fires rarely extended >250 m. During the late Holocene, landform controls have been strong. resulting in the bias of fires to south-facing hillslopes and thus allowing late-successional forest structure to persist for thousands of years in a large portion of the watershed. In contrast, the early Holocene regional climate and forest composition likely resulted in larger landscape tires that were not strongly controlled by landform factors. The millennial-scale TSF detected in this study supports the distinction of coastal temperate rain forest as being under a fundamentally different disturbance regime than other Pacific Northwest forests to the cast and south.","Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Management, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; Univ Washington, Coll Forest Resources, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",,"Gavin, DG (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, 2065 Morrill Hall, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",dgavin@life.uiuc.edu,"Gavin, Daniel G/C-9214-2009","Gavin, Daniel G/0000-0001-8743-3949",,,,83,139,146,2,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,2003,84,1,,,,,186,201,,10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[0186:HFHOAC]2.0.CO;2,,,16,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,642FC,WOS:000180792700017,,,,,2022-02-14

A pollen-based vegetation reconstruction indicates five periods of vegetation change. At 10,300 cal yr B.P. Pinus-Juniperus parkland colonized the valley and by 7600 cal yr B.P. was replaced by mixed stands of Pinus, Picea and Pseudotsuga/Larix. Fire frequencies increased to their Holocene maximums during the 8200-4000 cal yr B.P. period. From 5500-4500 cal yr B.P. Pseudotsuga/Larix reached its maximum extent in the Kootenay Valley under a more frequent fire regime. At 5000 cal yr B.P. Picea and Abies began to expand in the area and by 4500 cal yr B.P. the forest shifted to a closed montane spruce forest type with dramatically reduced fire frequency. The shift to less frequent forest fires after 4500 cal yr B.P., along with a moisterPicea - dominated closed forest, corresponds to Neoglacial advances in the Canadian Rockies and Coast Mountains. Fire intervals after 4000 cal yr B.P. are significantly longer than the shorter fire intervals of the early to mid Holocene. A return to drier, more open forest condition occurs between 2400-1200 cal yr B.P. with a slight increase in fire activity and summer drought events. Lower lake levels inferred by charophyte accumulation rates during the 2400-1200 cal yr B.P. interval support this moisture regime shift. An abrupt shift toPicea dominated forest occurred from 1200-1000 cal yr B.P. and a final period of wet-closed forest cover reaches its maximum extent from 700-150 cal yr B.P. that appears to be a response to Little Ice Age cooling. Present forests are within their natural range of variability but are predicted to shift again to a drier more open structure with increased Pseudotsuga/Larix cover. More frequent stand replacing fires and increased area burned likely will accompany this change due to continued global warming.","No Arizona Univ, Quaternary Sci Program, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; Univ Calgary, Dept Geol & Geophys, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; No Arizona Univ, Ctr Environm Sci, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA",,"Hallett, DJ (corresponding author), Queens Univ, Dept Geog, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",HALLETTD@post.QUEENSU.CA,"Hallett, Douglas/G-4968-2011",,,,,117,40,43,3,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-2728,1573-0417,,J PALEOLIMNOL,J.

Radiocarbon dates ranged from 182 to 9558 cal. yr BP, with prominent peaks in the probability distribution of calibrated dates at c. 7100, 3900, 2300, 1600 and 250-1000 cal. yr BP. The inferred median fire return interval (FRI) was 800-1200 cal. yr, depending on the extent of inbuilt age errors resulting from charring of wood pre-dating actual fire ages. This FRI is likely an overestimate, as less severe events may not have created sufficient erosion and slope instability to preserve a record of charcoal in buried soils and slope deposits. Median time since fire was 467 cal. yr based on ages of the uppermost charcoal found at each site, but the severity of heart-rots in the dominant redcedars (Thuja plicata Donn ex D. Don) prevented independent confirmation of stand ages by dendrochronology. Sites with multiple charcoal-containing layers having similar radiocarbon ages can be explained with reference to contemporary post-fire mass-wasting processes. Peaks in fire-related sedimentation probability coincided broadly with periods of higher fire frequency c. 600-1000, 1300-2400 and 3500-4500 cal. yr BP inferred from sedimentary charcoal records at subalpine sites in southwestern BC.

A broad isotopic enrichment of similar to16% through a 9-m-thick sedimentary sequence in the main basin is interpreted to indicate a shift from C-3 to C-4 plant dominance. A second isotopic record from a 4-m-thick sequence recovered southwest of the modern lakes corroborates this conclusion. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dates of an eolian sand (depth = 60 cm) and fluvial sand (depth = 3 30 cm) from the 9-m sequence are 27.6 +/- 1.4 and 122.4 +/- 9.5 ka, respectively, indicating that the entire record is likely to span several hundred thousand years. C4 plants dominate only after 120 ka. Conversion of C-3 woodland to C-4 grassland requires a decrease in total precipitation and increased seasonality of precipitation, reflecting a long-term trend toward a more and and monsoon-dominated climate regime in NW Australia. The rapid shift from mixed C-3/C-4 to dominantly C-4 vegetation after 120 ka may reflect an acceleration of landscape change in the Late Quaternary. Other Australian records that indicate increased continental aridity in the Late Quaternary support the Lake Gregory evidence. However, neither of the Lake Gregory isotopic records mimics the global oxygen isotope record, suggesting that temperature has not played a significant role in forcing vegetation change in this region.

Two sites (Crawford Lake and Twiss Marl Pond) were investigated using combined pollen and plant-macrofossil stratigraphic data. Comparison of multivariate analysis of pollen data with climate variations inferred independently from oxygen isotopes at the same site facilitated systematic evaluations of climate-vegetation interactions during different stages of vegetation development. Pollen results show a distinctive successional change from Alnus-Dryas-Cyperaceae sparse tundra or periglacial desert to Salix-Juniperus-Cyperaceae dense tundra, with abundant arctic/alpine plant macrofossils, during the first few centuries after ice retreat. The area around the two sites was then dominated by Picea (c. 12 000-10 000 C-14 BP). Vegetation shifts, summarized by log-contrast principal component analysis of the pollen record, indicated a lagged response of forests to deglacial climate warming. The major vegetation shift at c. 7500 C-14 BP from coniferous Pinus-dominated to mixed forests probably corresponded to a major shift from deglacial to full postglacial climates. Vegetation during the mid- and late Holocene responded more directly to natural (drought-triggered pathogen-induced Tsuga decline) and human disturbances (aboriginal and EuroCanadian settlements). This study demonstrates that bedrock basins most faithfully recorded the earliest vegetation change because they usually experienced a short delay in lake formation after ice retreat.","Lehigh Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA",,"Yu, ZC (corresponding author), Lehigh Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA.",ziy2@lehigh.edu,"Yu, Zicheng/D-4108-2012",,,,,113,27,28,1,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0028-646X,1469-8137,,NEW PHYTOL,New Phytol.,FEB,2003,157,2,,,,,365,390,,10.1046/j.1469-8137.2003.00678.x,,,26,Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences,639CH,WOS:000180609700018,33873648,Bronze,,,2022-02-14

Thin (0.5 cm) slices, representing time intervals of c. 50 years each from 11 800 to 7800 cal. year bp, were analysed and the data compared with independent palaeoclimatic proxies to study vegetational responses to environmental change. 2 Alpine plant communities (e.g. with Salix herbacea) were established at 11 600-11 500 cal. year bp, when oxygen-isotope records showed that temperatures increased by c. 3-4 degrees C within decades. Larix decidua trees reached the site at c. 11 350 cal. year bp, probably in response to further warming by 1-2 degrees C. Forests dominated by L. decidua persisted until 9600 cal. year bp, when Pinus cembra became more important. 3 The dominance of Larix decidua for two millennia is explained by dry summer conditions, and possibly low winter temperatures, which favoured it over the late-successional Pinus cembra. Environmental conditions were a result of variations in the earth's orbit, leading to a maximum of summer and a minimum of winter solar radiation. Other heliophilous and drought-adapted species, such as Dryas octopetala and Juniperus nana, could persist in the open L. decidua forests, but were out-competed when the shade-tolerant P. cembra expanded. 4 The relative importance of Larix decidua decreased during periods of diminished solar radiation at 11 100, 10 100 and 9400 cal. year bp. Stable concentrations of L. decidua indicate that these percentage oscillations were caused by temporary increases of Pinus cembra, Dryas octopetala and Juniperus nana that can be explained by increases in moisture and/or decreases in summer temperature. 5 The final collapse of Larix decidua at 8400 cal. year bp was possibly related to abrupt climatic cooling as a consequence of a large meltwater input to the North Atlantic. Similarly, the temporary exclusion of Pinus cembra from tree line at 10 600-10 200 cal. year bp may be related to slowing down of thermohaline circulation at 10 700-10 300 cal. year bp. 6 Our results show that tree line vegetation was in dynamic equilibrium with climate, even during periods of extraordinarily rapid climatic change. They also imply that forecasted global warming may trigger rapid upslope movements of the tree line of up to 800 m within a few decades or centuries at most, probably inducing large-scale displacements of plant species as well as irrecoverable biodiversity losses.","Univ Bern, Inst Plant Sci, Sect Palaeoecol, CH-3013 Bern, Switzerland",,"Tinner, W (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Plant Sci, Sect Palaeoecol, Altenbergrain 21, CH-3013 Bern, Switzerland.",willy.tinner@ips.unibe.ch,"Tinner, Willy/F-6727-2013","Tinner, Willy/0000-0001-7352-0144; Boltshauser-Kaltenrieder, Petra/0000-0001-7079-6284",,,,65,129,130,1,51,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Both pollen records show mosaic vegetation with grasslands, heaths and woodlands prior to 11 300 cal. BP. Pinus-dominated mixed forest was initially established by 11 000 cal. BP. By 10 000 cal. BP, mixed forest with higher species diversity was fully established. Expansion of broad-leaved trees began at about 8600 cal. BP, indicating the onset of the mid-Holocene thermal maximum in Scandinavia. Following the Ulmus decline similar to 5800 cal. BP, the regional forest became much more open due to increased human disturbance. Both basins were isolated during the period of 11 300-11 000 cal. BP, and subsequently in contact with the Ancylus Lake between 10 700 and 9800 cal. BP. Low abundance of brackish-water diatoms at Smygen suggests that this basin was connected with the Baltic Sea between 9800 and 8600 cal. BP, corresponding to the Early Littorina Sea phase. Hunnemara was isolated during this period. The two basins were in turn flooded at 8600 and 8300 cal. BP, as a result of global sea-level rise. A sedimentary hiatus (8300-7500 cal. BP) was present at Hunnemara, probably caused by a rapid sea-level rise related to global meltwater pulse 3. Aquatic macrofossil and mineral magnetic proxies reveal several minor transgressions at both sites, probably regulated by centennial-scale variations in regional storminess. Hunnemara was isolated from the Baltic Basin by 3100 cal.

Although constituting the first known fossil vertebrates of the Tibetan Plateau and discovered in early scientific expeditions in the 1930s, mammalian fossils from Qaidam Basin have not played a significant role in studying the basin stratigraphy. Our explorations in the Qaidam Basin during the past 8 years have resulted in the first well documented collection of fossil vertebrates from there. In addition to being the best organisms for terrestrial biostratigraphy in the Cenozoic, the new fossil vertebrates offer a unique window into the ancient biotas that chronicle the late Cenozoic uplift of the plateau and associated environmental changes. Here we establish for the first time a faunal sequence of early Oligocene to early Pliocene age. Four mammalian faunas are recognized: Olongbuluk Mammal Fauna (middle Miocene), Tuosu Mammal Fauna (early late Miocene), Shengou Mammal Fauna (early late Miocene), and Huaitoutala Mammal Fauna (early Pliocene). All four mammal faunas can be directly or indirectly tied to a paleomagnetic section in the Olongbuluk-Huaitoutala area, permitting robust calibration of the chronology of these faunas. At least four fish faunas are also found: Lulehe Fish Fauna (late early to early late Oligocene), Shengou Fish Fauna (early late Miocene), Eboliang Fish Fauna (late late Miocene to early Pliocene), and Yahu Fish Fauna (early Pliocene). The fish faunas represent the only records of their respective times in the Tibetan Plateau and thus by themselves cannot be used for age determination.

The study aimed to evaluate (1) the nature of climate changes that forced the late-Holocene lowering of altitudinal tree limit in the region, the timing of which is known from prior studies based on radiocarbon dating of subfossil wood, and (2) the impact of these vegetational changes on an aquatic ecosystem. Arboreal pollen and plant macrofossil data confirm the persistence of trees in the lake catchment at least from c. 9700 cal. BP until c. 3700 cal. BP. Although growing-season temperature is commonly believed to be the dominant factor driving boreal forest tree-limit variations in the region, a chironomid-based reconstruction of mean July air temperature suggests that local deforestation during the late Holocene was not accompanied by a significant cooling. The tree-limit retreat was more likely caused by increasing effective moisture and declining length of the growing season. The ecohydrological response of Lake Spaime to this combination of climate and vegetational changes included a decline in primary productivity, as indicated by an abrupt decrease in sediment organic matter content, while associated increases in organic delta(13)C, delta(15)N and C/N point to diminished fluxes and altered balance of catchment-derived nutrients following deforestation. The decline in aquatic productivity is also marked by a distinct change in the mineral magnetic properties, from a high magnetic concentration assemblage dominated by fine-grained magnetite of biogenic origin to one dominated by background levels of coarse-grained detrital magnetite.","Lund Univ, GeoBiosphere Sci Ctr, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden; Univ Bergen, Inst Zool, N-5007 Bergen, Norway; Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada; Univ Waterloo, Dept Earth Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; Univ Waterloo, Quaternary Sci Inst, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; Gothenburg Univ, Dept Earth Sci, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; Stockholm Univ, Dept Phys Geog & Quaternary Geol, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; Uppsala Univ, Tandem Lab, SE-75121 Uppsala, Sweden",,"Hammarlund, D (corresponding author), Lund Univ, GeoBiosphere Sci Ctr, Solvegatan 12, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden.",dan.hammarlund@geol.lu.se,"Hammarlund, Dan/B-9698-2008","Snowball, Ian/0000-0002-6257-3088; Hammarlund, Dan/0000-0001-7147-8173",,,,94,62,62,1,35,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0959-6836,1477-0911,,HOLOCENE,Holocene,NOV,2004,14,6,,,,,862,876,,10.1191/0959683604hl756rp,,,15,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Physical Geography; Geology,871AS,WOS:000225101900007,,Green Published,,,2022-02-14

New research described here indicates the benefits of applying multidisciplinary high-resolution sampling and analysis on the Middle Devonian lake deposits of the Orcadian Basin in order to understand lake palaeoecology and response to water chemistry change and possible climate change. In a continuously sampled 4 m-thick lake cycle in two correlated boreholes in Caithness there are two distinct features. There is a broad trend in delta C-13 of sedimentary organic matter from high values in the shallow water deposits to lower values in the deeper water deposits, attributed to changing contributions from terrestrial plant material (delta C-13(org) c. - 28 parts per thousand) and algal material (delta C-13(org) c. - 33 parts per thousand). This variation is consistent with palynological data and is best explained by proximal-distal variation as the lake filled. A smaller but well-correlated up-section decreasing delta C-13(org) trend occurs over approximately I in, starting at the cycle centre where the lake was at its deepest. Since the same feature is seen in two boreholes, we suggest that local effects of migrated bitumen, diagenesis or facies changes are unlikely to be the cause, and that changes in the carbon cycle of the lake are responsible. Explanations for this trend may relate to the source of carbon that algae utilised as the lake changed from a fresher to a more saline environment, and to changes in the carbon isotope composition of the lake water during periods of enhanced productivity.

The response of ecosystems to past and future climatic change is difficult to understand due to the uncertainties in the direction and magnitude of changes and the relative importance of interactions between climate and local factors. In boreal ecosystems such interactions may dictate the response to climatic change, but the interaction of climate, vegetation composition and the fire regime remains poorly understood. 2. Sediment cores from lakes in south-central Alaska were analysed for lithology, macrofossils, pollen and charcoal to investigate the relationships between moisture availability, species composition and mean fire return intervals (MFI). 3. Macrofossil and lithological evidence suggests that variations in effective moisture occurred over the past 7000 years and that the regional climate has been wetter during the past c. 3800 years than before. 4. Boreal forests existed in the region throughout the past 7000 years. Picea glauca and Picea mariana were the prevalent forest species around Chokasna Lake, whereas P. glauca and hardwood species (e.g. Betula) co-dominated the landscape around Moose Lake. Picea mariana replaced P. glauca as the dominant Picea species around Chokasna Lake at c. 2000 BP. 5. MFI was > 500 years before 3800 BP, except from 5800 to 5000 BP at Moose Lake and 5400 to 4550 BP at Chokasna Lake, when values were c. 200 years. MFI decreased to c. 200 years during the late-Holocene at both sites and to c. 150 years after 2000 BP at Chokasna Lake. 6. At both sites, fires occurred more frequently under wetter climatic conditions. Our results therefore support other recent studies demonstrating that warmer/drier climatic conditions do not necessarily induce greater fire importance. A combination of increased ignition by lightning strikes and seasonal-moisture variability probably resulted in more frequent fires under wetter conditions.","Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",,"Lynch, JA (corresponding author), N Cent Coll, Dept Biol, POB 3063, Naperville, IL 60540 USA.",jalynch@noctrl.edu,,,,,,55,96,106,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Focusing on Bison, Equus, and Mammuthus from three geographical areas of Florida (north, central, and south) during the Rancholabrean, this study uses values of stable carbon isotope composition of tooth enamel carbonate collected from the literature to determine dietary variability, and whether hypsodonty and comparisons with modem analogs accurately represent the scope of forage taxa could utilize. Carbon isotope values show no significant differences in diet between Bison, Equus, and Mammuthus within any of the three designated geographic areas of Florida. The data do show significant differences in diet for Bison between north Florida and south Florida, for Equus between north Florida and south Florida and between central Florida and south Florida, and for Mammuthus between central Florida and south Florida. These results suggest floral differences among the geographic areas of Florida. Mean delta(13)C values for the taxa suggest that each was an intermediate feeder with a strong preference for grasses and sedges. Comparisons of diet in this study with those based on modem analogs and hypsodonty indicate that both techniques may accurately represent a taxon's average diet. However, the range in delta(13)C values observed in individuals extended from strict C-4 feeding to strict C-3 feeding and suggests a range in diet from grazing to browsing. This wide range in apparent diet indicates that multiple specimens are required to accurately interpret the feeding strategy of taxa and the relevance of the diet of animals as an indicator of environment in which they lived.

Results indicate substantial variability in basin hydro-ecology over the past 300 years ranging from seasonal to periodic desiccation in the 1700s to markedly wetter conditions during the early 1800s to early 1900s. The reconstruction is consistent with (1) dry climatic conditions that defined the peak of the Little Ice Age and subsequent amelioration evident in conventional ring-width and isotopic analyses of tree-ring records located hydrologically and climatically upstream of the PAD, and (2) Peace River flood history inferred from sub-annual magnetic susceptibility measurements from another lake sediment record in the Peace sector of the PAD. Although regulation of the Peace River for hydroelectric power generation since 1968 has long been considered a major stressor of the PAD ecosystem leading to reduced frequency of ice-jam and open-water flooding and an extended period of drying, our results show that current hydro-ecological status is not unprecedented as both wetter and drier conditions have persisted for decades in the recent past under natural climatic variability. Furthermore, paleolimnological evidence from Spruce Island Lake indicates that recently observed dryness is part of a longer trend which began some 20-40 years prior to Peace River regulation.

The sequence of vegetation change at the site is broadly comparable with the pattern of climatically induced changes observed in many other pollen records in southeast Australia. Open woodland-herbland and woodland-forest communities correspond with glacial and interglacial periods respectively, with an additional change towards a more open understorey vegetation assemblage over the last 40 000 yr. The driest conditions appear to have occurred during the, height of the last glacial (some time between 30 and 20.k cal. yr BP). This is consistent with other records from southeast Australia, and provides support for a poleward shift in the subtropical anticyclone belt and, less certainly, for the thesis that the Southern Hemisphere westerlies intensified during this period. In marked contrast to most sites in southeast Australia, Casuarinaceae dominates the pollen record through the height of the last glacial period and into the Holocene. The postglacial climatic amelioration is accompanied by the general reappearance of tree pollen in the record, by the disappearance of several open and disturbed environment indicator taxa, by increases in organic sediment deposition and pollen taxon diversity, and by higher water balances. While climate appears to have been the major control on patterns of vegetation change at this site throughout most of the last glacial-interglacial cycle, changes in depositional environment and hydrology have also played a role. Significantly, substantial increases in the rate and magnitude of many indicators of environmental disturbance since European settlement suggest that humans are now the most important mechanism for environmental change.

A between-class (between-station) Correspondence Analysis (CA) showed that, on the scale of the alluvial plain, habitat is a major factor influencing the species assemblages. The assemblage composition on the transversal floodplain gradient was compared with existing data on assemblages from the main channel of the Garonne River (South of France) and three of its floodplain waters (two side arms and one oxbow lake). In order to work at the level of taxonomic determination commonly used in paleoecological studies, the overall dataset (lower Rhone + Garonne) was analyzed to the genus level. The genus level analysis confirmed that chironomid assemblages can be used to characterize the connectivity of small waterbodies with the main river channel and 44 chironomid genera were classified according to their hydrological preferences (lentic habitat taxa, ubiquitous taxa and lotic habitat taxa). This classification was then applied to a paleoecological dataset from the Saint-Omer basin (North of France) in order to test the potential of chironomids for paleoecological studies on fluvial environments. The results presented here highlighted this potential and indicate that river chironomid assemblages can be used as descriptors for alluvial habitats, and allow researchers to evaluate the level of connectivity of these habitats with the main river channel during floods. River chironomid assemblages are a promising tool for reconstructing past hydrological changes and for obtaining information on paleoflood periodicity.","Univ Aix Marseille 3, Inst Mediterraneen Ecol & Paleoecol, UMR 6116, CNRS, F-13397 Marseille, France; USTL, UMR 8110, CNRS, Proc & Bilan Domaines Sedimentaires, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France",,"Gandouin, E (corresponding author), Univ Aix Marseille 3, Inst Mediterraneen Ecol & Paleoecol, UMR 6116, CNRS, Case C31, F-13397 Marseille, France.",manu.gandouin@laposte.net,"Gandouin, Emmanuel/AAM-9745-2021; Vliet-Lanoe, Van/A-1622-2009; Maasri, Alain/F-7995-2010","Gandouin, Emmanuel/0000-0001-6970-9630; Vliet-Lanoe, Van/0000-0003-1183-0846; Maasri, Alain/0000-0003-1236-8374",,,,74,34,34,2,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-2728,1573-0417,,J PALEOLIMNOL,J.

The environmental shift is particularly manifested as a change in the hydrological budget and vegetation within numerous swamp and lake catchments. The majority of sites in tropical Africa record a shift to drier environmental conditions that is in opposition to South America, where a shift to a wetter environment is generally recorded. The strength of between site signals varies from being relatively complacent to dramatic, in some cases reflective of whole-scale vegetation change. The magnitude of change is mainly dependent of the location of the site and the proxy under investigation. These ecosystem changes are likely to reflect changed precipitation regimes, increased evaporation, and or an extension/contraction of the dry season. This pronounced Holocene environmental shift is particularly interesting, as the marked changes within the tropics are either weakly recorded, or non-existent, at more extensively studied temperate latitudes and polar regions. The Climate mechanisms responsible for this shift are reviewed and a model developed to explain such a strong signal from the: tropical areas without associated changes at high latitudes, such as changes in polar ice-sheet extent. We propose changes in Pacific Ocean sea-surface temperature regime, and the establishment of El Nino conditions have imparted a direct influence on tropical Atlantic SST that could explain the rapid changes in terrestrial palaeoecological records. Other components of the terrestrial -ocean -atmosphere system are also likely to be important contributory factors in the environmental shift, in particular the large changes in land surface conditions could contribute to the climate shift. Given the scenario for tropical environmental change, to a degree independent from high latitudes, targeted areas of future research are indicated that incorporate development of climate and ecosystem modelling and palaeoenvironmental investigation with a tropical focus.

On average delta C-13(P) differs by similar to 13 parts per thousand between modern C-3 (-22.6 to -26.8 parts per thousand) and C-4 (-9.2 to -17.7 parts per thousand) grass species. delta C-13(P) is 1.2-3.7 parts per thousand more negative for modern grass pollen treated with the same protocol as for fossil samples than for untreated modern samples. delta C-13(P) ranges from -20.1 to -25.4 parts per thousand for grass pollen in the middle-Holocene sediments from West Olaf Lake, located near the modern tallgrass prairie-forest ecotone in western Minnesota. We applied a two end-member mixing model to estimate fluctuations in C-3 and C-4 grass abundance around this lake. Both C-3 and C-4 grasses expanded relative to Ambrosia and Artemisia with the decline of aridity from 8000 to 4000 BP. C-3 grasses were generally more abundant than C-4 grasses throughout the middle Holocene, suggesting the presence of mixed-grass prairie around West Olaf Lake. The grass delta C-13(P)-based estimates Of C-4 plant abundance were lower than charcoal delta C-13-based estimates, probably reflecting different source areas of pollen and charcoal. Grass delta C-13(P) also revealed greater submillennial-scale variability in C-3 and C-4 abundance than charcoal delta C-13. These results suggest that grass delta C-13(P) can provide palaeoenvironmental information not available from other proxy indicators.","Univ Illinois, Program Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; Univ Illinois, Dept Geol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; Boston Univ, Dept Biol, Stable Isotope Lab, Boston, MA 02215 USA",,"Nelson, DM (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Program Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 265 Morrill Hall,505 S Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",dmnelson@life.uiuc.edu; fshu@life.uiuc.edu,"Nelson, David/AAP-9412-2020; Nelson, David M/D-5596-2009","Nelson, David/0000-0003-2755-5535; Nelson, David M/0000-0003-2755-5535",,,,37,28,30,0,16,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0959-6836,1477-0911,,HOLOCENE,Holocene,SEP,2006,16,6,,,,,819,825,,10.1191/0959683606hol974rp,,,7,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Physical Geography; Geology,105ST,WOS:000242053300004,,,,,2022-02-14

This similarity suggests that the ecological processes controlling. re ignition and spread were the same. At the three sites, the intervals were shorter before 8600 cal yr BP ( calibrated years before present), between 7500 and 4500 cal yr BP, and after 2500 cal yr BP. Geomorphological and vegetation factors cannot explain the observed change, because the three sites are located in the same large ecological region characterized by Pinus sylvestris-Ericaceae mesic forests, established on morainic deposits at the same elevation. Archaeological chronologies also do not match the. re chronologies. A climatic interpretation is therefore the most likely explanation of the long-term regional pattern of. re. Although recent human activities between the 18th and the 20th centuries have clearly affected the. re regime, the dominant factor controlling it for 10 000 years in northern Sweden has probably been climatic.","EPHE, CNRS, USTL,Inst Bot, UMR 5059,Ctr Bioarchaeol & Ecol, F-34090 Montpellier, France; Silvermuuseet, S-93090 Arjeplog, Sweden; Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Vegetat Ecol, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; Off Natl Forets, F-48000 Mende, France",,"Carcaillet, C (corresponding author), EPHE, CNRS, USTL,Inst Bot, UMR 5059,Ctr Bioarchaeol & Ecol, 163 Rue Broussonet, F-34090 Montpellier, France.",,"Carcaillet, Christopher/G-1218-2011","Carcaillet, Christopher/0000-0002-6632-1507",,,,73,92,92,0,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,FEB,2007,88,2,,,,,465,477,,10.1890/0012-9658(2007)88[465:LFFNLT]2.0.CO;2,,,13,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,156SA,WOS:000245668400020,17479764,,,,2022-02-14

Habitat currently dominated by Mojave Desert Larrea tridentata (creosote bush) was occupied prior to ca. 11,500 years BP by Pinus monophylla (pi (n) over tilde on), Juniperus osteosperma (Utah juniper), Purshia mexicana (bitterbush), Cercocarpus ledifolius (mountain mahogany), and Prunus fasciculata (desert almond) woodland above 1000 m. P monophylla-Juniperus woodland was widespread over the southern and central Mojave Desert. However, less than 150 km north of the central Mojave, J. osteosperma steppe dominated the landscape.

At elevations <1000 m desert scrub species of Lycium cooperi (wolfberry), Salvia mojavensis (Mojave sage) and the mesophytic Prosopis juliflora (mesquite) occurred near the shore of pluvial Lake Mojave from ca. 8810 to 8430 years BP. Larrea is not recorded on the xeric carbonate substrates (605 m) until ca. 6990 years BP, then took over 2000 years to dominate the regional landscape. Modem vegetation associates such as Thamnosma montana (desert rue) and Atriplex confertifolia (shadscale) were established by ca. 4500 years BP. Late Holocene vegetation changes document Neoglacial cooling and wetter conditions than today between ca. 3490 and 2640 years BP, paralleling the regional pluvial lake highstands and marsh deposit records. Decreases of mesophytic Mojave Desert associates in the Granite Mountains suggest climates similar to today's aridity between ca. 1970 and 1440 years BR Mesophytic species increase in middens dating between ca. 1390 and 700 years BP at higher elevation sites; during the same time Prosopis occurs at lower elevation sites.

This study compares beta diversities between the Great Basin and the Great Plains of the western USA over the last 17 Myr. Today, the Great Basin is a topographically diverse desert scrubland to woodland and the Great Plains are low-relief temperate grassland, but 17 Ma they were more similar in topography, climate and land cover. A georeferenced database of mammal occurrences, complied from several sources, is used to test two hypotheses for the elevation of Great Basin beta diversity: (1) that tectonic change of the topography has driven increased habitat packing in high- and low-elevation habitats, and (2) that climatic cycling in the Pleistocene has driven faunas from neighbouring provinces to overlap in the region. Location The Great Basin of the USA, centred on Nevada, and the central Great Plains of the USA, centred on Nebraska. Methods Mammalian faunal lists compiled from published records and the records of many museums, available online, were partitioned into time-slices ranging from the recent to 17 Myr old. Beta diversity was calculated for each time-slice in two ways: multiplicative beta diversity using first-order jackknife richness, and additive beta diversity using Simpson's evenness. Results Beta diversity is elevated in Nevada relative to Nebraska today. Beta diversity has been higher in the Great Basin since the Pleistocene and possibly since the late Early Hemphillian (c. 7 Ma). Beta diversity in the Late Barstovian (c. 13.5 Ma) of the Great Plains was higher even than beta diversity in the Great Basin of today. Main conclusions The elevated beta diversity in the Hemphillian supports the tectonic change hypothesis. The patterns of beta diversity in the Recent, Pleistocene and Hemphillian all suggest that local-scale processes are important. The beta diversity of the Late Barstovian Great Plains supports other studies indicating increased primary productivity or species packing.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Museum Paleontol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,"Davis, EB (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Museum Paleontol, 1101 Valley Life Sci Bldg, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",daviseb@socrates.berkeley.edu,,,,,,80,40,41,2,25,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1466-822X,,,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

Location Eastern Brazilian Amazonia, Amapa State. Methods The fossil pollen and charcoal records of two lakes in Amapa (Marcio and Tapera) were used to provide a Holocene palaeoecological history of eastern Amazonian savannas. Detrended correspondence analysis was used to enhance the patterns of sample distribution along the sediment core. Results Even though sedimentary hiatuses were recognized in the sediment cores from both lakes, a marked change in vegetation from closed forests with swamp elements to open flooded savanna at c. 5000 yr BP was evident from the pollen record. Charcoal analysis revealed a pattern of increased accumulation of charred particles coincident with the establishment of savanna vegetation, suggesting higher fire frequency near the lakes. Because the timing of the sedimentary hiatus overlapped with the highest Holocene sea level, which would have increased the local water table preventing the lakes from drying out, we infer that both lakes used to depend heavily on flood waters, and the sedimentary gap was caused by reduced discharge from the Amazon River, due to a dry period in the Andes, when precipitation levels markedly decreased between 8000 and 5000 yr BP. The lack of Andean pollen (probably river transported) in the sediment record after this event and the existence of similar records near the study site make this interpretation more appealing. The resumption of sedimentation in Lake Marcio, contemporaneous with falling sea level and increasingly wet conditions in the Andes after 5000 yr BP, indicates that Holocene sea-level variation did not play an important role in maintaining lake levels. Main conclusions The study site recorded-long-term occupation by pre-Columbian peoples. However, it is still unclear whether these disjoint savannas have an anthropogenic origin. Even though locally dry environmental conditions were inferred from both records, there is no evidence of a mid-Holocene dry climate in eastern Amazonia. Instead, the Amapa record indicates a connection between Andean climate and eastern Amazonia, demonstrating the need for a better understanding of the impacts and magnitude of climate changes.","Florida Inst Technol, Dept Biol Sci, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA",,"De Toledo, MB (corresponding author), Univ Fed Fluminense, Dept Geol, Av Gal Milton Tavares Souza,S-N 4 Andar, BR-24210340 Niteroi, RJ, Brazil.",mtoledo@igeo.uff.br,"de Toledo, Mauro B/N-5732-2015",,,,,47,32,32,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-0270,1365-2699,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

The model was used to investigate potential effects of environment and litter-quality related parameters on peat accumulation, and to examine how well past changes in net accumulation can be reconstructed from the peat core record. 2 Sensitivity analysis of the model indicates that the relative ability of different input parameters to increase peat accumulation changed over time. Short-term results, e.g. from litter decomposition studies, therefore cannot be extrapolated to predict peat accumulation over longer time-scales. 3 In simulations that examined the long-term development of static community types, peat accumulation responded more strongly to water table position in bogs than in fens. In several cases, the relative peat accumulation potential of different community types changed over time. 4 Successional change (fen to bog) increased or decreased net peat accumulation, depending on the water table of the simulated bog. If succession was accompanied by lowered water tables, modelled peatlands showed a net loss of organic matter over extended periods of time. Effects of decreased litter quality in drier communities were outweighed by decreased productivity and greater decomposition in the thicker acrotelm. 5 Plots of cumulative organic matter mass vs. age for simulated profiles were often 'concave', as predicted by models that assume continued decomposition of deep peat. However, simulations that involved community change violated the assumptions of such models, and reconstructed actual (net) rates of organic matter accumulation were unreliable in spite of excellent model fits. 6 Current peat accumulation models often assume that environmental change will affect productivity, but not the botanical composition of peatland communities. Over decadal and centennial time-scales, however, community change will probably play a key role in determining peatland responses to climate change. Results obtained here suggest that interactions between environmental and community-based controls are complex, and their net effect may not be predictable from current data. In order to develop predictive models that work over these time-scales, we need a better understanding of feedback mechanisms between hydrology, community composition, and organic matter accumulation in peatlands.","Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada",,"Bauer, IE (corresponding author), Canadian Forest Serv, No Forestry Ctr, 5320 122 St, Edmonton, AB T6H 3S5, Canada.",ilka.bauer@ualberta.net,,,,,,59,38,40,0,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

This paper synthesizes geo-chronology, sedimentology, paleoecology, geochemistry and hydrology studies comparing the history of deltaic deposits from watersheds of various sizes and deforestation disturbance levels along the eastern coast of the lake in Tanzania and Burundi. Intersite differences are related to climate change, differences in the histories of forested vs. deforested watersheds, differences related to regional patterns of deforestation, and differences related to interactions of deforestation and climate effects. Climate change is linked to variations in sediment accumulation rates, charcoal accumulation, lake level and water chemistry, especially during the arid-humid fluctuations of the latter part of the Little Ice Age. Differences between forested and deforested watersheds are manifested by major increases in sediment accumulation rates in the latter (outside the range of climatically driven variability and for the last &SIM; 40 years unprecedented in comparison with other records from the lake in the late Holocene), differences in eroded sediment and watershed stream composition, and compositional or diversity trends in lake faunal communities related to sediment inundation. Variability in regional patterns of deforestation is illustrated by the timing of transitions from numerous sedimentologic, paleoecologic and geochemical indicators. These data suggest that extensive watershed deforestation occurred as early as the late-18th to the early-19th centuries in the northern part of the Lake Tanganyika catchment, in the late-19th to early-20th centuries in the northern parts of modern-day Tanzania, and in the mid-20th century in central Tanzania. Rapid increases in sediment and charcoal accumulation rates, palynological and lake faunal changes occurred in the early-1960s. We interpret this to be the result of greatly enhanced flushing of sediments in previously deforested watersheds triggered by extraordinary rainfall in 1961/62. Regional differences in deforestation histories can be understood in light of the very different cultural and demographic histories of the northern and central parts of the lake shoreline. Incursion of slaving and ivory caravans from the Indian Ocean to the central coast of Lake Tanganyika by the early-19th century, with their attendant diseases, reduced human and elephant populations and therefore maintained forest cover in this region through the late-19th to early-20th centuries. In contrast, the northeastern portion of the lakeshore did not experience the effects of the caravan trades and consequently experienced high human population densities and widespread deforestation much earlier. These studies demonstrate the importance of paleolimnological data for making informed risk assessments of the potential effects of watershed deforestation on long-term lake ecosystem response in the Lake Tanganyika catchment. Differences in sediment yield and lake floor distribution of that yield, linked to factors such as watershed size, slope, and sediment retention, must be accounted for in management plans for both human occupation of currently forested watersheds and the development of future underwater reserves.","Univ Arizona, Dept Geosci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; Terra Nostra, Tucson, AZ 85741 USA; Tanzania Petr Dev Corp, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; Univ Washington, Sch Oceanog, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Tulane Univ, Dept Geol, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; Vassar Coll, Environm Sci Program, Poughkeepsie, NY 12604 USA; Univ Dar Es Salaam, Dept Geol, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania",,"Cohen, AS (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Geosci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",acohen@geo.arizona.edu,"Alin, Simone/J-6836-2017","Alin, Simone/0000-0002-8283-1910",,,,49,52,52,1,43,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-2728,,,J PALEOLIMNOL,J.

Frans Vera's recent hypothesis that large mammals created mosaics of forest and openland vegetation in both regions throughout the Holocene has been particularly controversial and has provoked new approaches to conservation management. Thirty years earlier, American paleoecologists Herb Wright and Margaret Davis debated whether abundant ragweed pollen at Rogers Lake, Connecticut at 9500 yr BP signified local forest openings or long-distance transport of pollen from Midwestern prairies. Using new pollen records from Harvard Forest and the North American Pollen Database, we address this question and offer insights to the openland discussion. Ragweed and other forbs exceed 3.5% at five sites in a restricted area of southern New England between 10 100 and 7700 yr BP. Strong evidence suggests this pollen originated from the landscapes surrounding these sites (supporting Davis), as ragweed pollen percentages do not increase with longitude from New England to the Midwest. Ragweed pollen percentages are also unrelated to basin size and therefore unrelated to the proportion of extraregional pollen in New England. High forbs values were associated with increases in oak, decreases in white pine, and relatively high charcoal values. Modern pollen records with similar forb and tree percentages occur along the Prairie Peninsula region of the Upper Midwest. However, the closest analogue to the southern New England early Holocene assemblages comes from Massachusetts' Walden Pond in the early 18th century. These results and the affiliation of ragweed for open, disturbed habitats suggest that oak-pine forests with large openings persisted for over 2000 years due to dry conditions and perhaps increased fire frequency. This conclusion is corroborated by independent lake level and climate reconstructions. Because these early Holocene openlands have no detectable analogue in New England for the past 7000 years before European settlement, we suggest that all important openlands today are almost exclusively a legacy of Colonial agriculture and should be managed accordingly. Nonetheless, our results may have implications for forest dynamics accompanying projected climate change to more and conditions in New England over the next century.","Harvard Univ, Harvard Forest, Petersham, MA 01366 USA; Univ Minnesota, Limnol Res Ctr, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",,"Faison, EK (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Harvard Forest, Petersham, MA 01366 USA.",faison@fas.harvard.edu,,,,,,57,33,33,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,2006,87,10,,,,,2537,2547,,10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[2537:EHOISN]2.0.CO;2,,,11,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,098XU,WOS:000241557900014,17089662,Green Submitted,,,2022-02-14

Percentage plots of the individual species, compared With R-mode principal component and cluster analysis results, allowed us to divide the assemblages into three groups: temperate-water taxa, cool-water taxa, and no temperature-affinity taxa. We attempt correlations between these paleoecological groups and the major sea-surface temperature (SST) variations with tectonic and paleoceanographic changes in the Southern Ocean. During the late Eocene, the nannofossil assemblage data reveal that there were several minor SST decreases (coolings) from 36 to 34 Ma, before the Eocene/Oligocene (E/O) boundary. A sharp cooling event, dated at 33.54 Ma (earliest Oligocene), occurred about 160 kyr after the E/O boundary, which is dated at 33.7 Ma. Relatively stable, cool conditions are interpreted to persist until the latest Oligocene, when an increase in abundance of temperate-water taxa, which corresponds to an antithetical decrease in abundance of cool-water indicators, is recorded. On the basis of our dating, the opening of the Drake Passage, allowing shallow-water circulation, began by 33.54 Ma at the latest, while the establishment of deep-water connections through the Tasmanian Gateway occurred at 33 Ma, as suggested by Exon et al.

We use a paleoecological approach on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, to assess landscape-scale variation in pitch pine-oak vegetation and fire occurrence on the pre-European landscape and to determine changes resulting from European land use. Fossil pollen and charcoal preserved in seven lakes confirm a close link between landform and the pre-European distribution of vegetation. Pine forests, dominated by Pinus rigida, were closely associated with xeric outwash deposits, whereas oak-hardwood forests were associated with landforms having finer grained soils and variable topography. In general, fire was much more abundant on Cape Cod than most other areas in New England, but its occurrence varied geographically at two scales. On the western end of Cape Cod, fires were more prevalent in pine forests (outwash) than in oak-hardwood forests (moraines). In contrast, fires were less common on the narrow and north-south trending eastern Cape, perhaps because of physical limits on fire spread. The most rapid and substantial changes during the past 2000 years were initiated by European settlement, which produced a vegetation mosaic that today is less clearly tied to landform: Quercus and other hardwood trees declined in abundance in the early settlement period in association with land clearance, whereas Pinus has increased, especially during the past century, through natural reforestation and planting of abandoned fields and pastures. An increase in fossil charcoal following European settlement suggests that fire occurrence has risen substantially as a result of forest clearance and other land uses, reaching levels greater than at any time over the past 2000 years. Although fire was undoubtedly used by Native Americans and may have been locally important, we find no clear evidence that humans extensively modified fire regimes or vegetation before European settlement. Instead, climate change over the past several thousand years and European land use over the past 300 years have been the most important agents of change on this landscape.","Harvard Univ, Harvard Forest, Petersham, MA 01366 USA; Univ Minnesota, Limnol Res Ctr, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",,"Parshall, T (corresponding author), Kellogg Biol Stn, 3700 E Gull Lake Dr, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA.",parshal4@kbs.msu.edu,,,,,,92,46,48,1,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAR,2003,84,3,,,,,736,748,,10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[0736:LTHOVA]2.0.CO;2,,,13,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,656VF,WOS:000181629500025,,Green Submitted,,,2022-02-14

Prior to this time, molluscs were likely excluded where grounded ice extended from the 2 km thick Cordilleran ice sheet on mainland British Columbia. Low water temperatures, high sedimentation rates, high turbidity, dilution, and low primary productivity limited invertebrate colonization subsequent to the LGM, a period of rapid sea-level and climate change. As an adult, M. nasuta is a facultative deposit-suspension feeder that tolerates high turbidity and lowered salinity, and its pediveligers and early juveniles must also have been able to survive these conditions. Subsequently, in addition to M. nasuta, Macoma irus (inquinata), Saxidomus giganteus, Protothaca staminea, Protothaca tenerrima, Hiatella pholadis, Clinocardium nuttallii, and Mytilus trossulus constituted a typical intertidal bivalve assemblage. These findings are explained in terms of the physiology, feeding mechanisms, development, and sediment preferences of living molluscs. The disappearance of most bivalve species between similar to11000 and 10000 C-14 years BP indicates the onset of a short interval of low sea-surface temperatures coincident with the Younger Dryas cooling event. Some cold-hardy species persisted, including Clinocardium californiense, Mya truncata, and Serripes groenlandicus. Bivalve species not previously reported as Pleistocene fossils were collected in sediments dating older than 10000 C-14 years BP. They include Macoma incongrua, Musculus taylori, Mytilimeria nuttallii, and Tellina nuculoides. Fossil assemblages of intertidal molluscs are used to map ancient shorelines and indicate which species were available as a subsistence resource for early peoples from at least 13210+/-80 C-14 years BP. Intertidal food biomass densities may have reached present commercially harvested levels on southern Moresby Island by 8800+/-70 C-14 years BP and on northern Graham Island by 8990+/-50 C-14 years BP. When early peoples might have been migrating along the littoral zone, the molluscan productivity of the outer coast was much higher than it is at present.","Univ Victoria, Dept Geog, Victoria, BC V8W 3N5, Canada; Geol Survey Canada, Nat Resources Canada, Sidney, BC V8L 4B2, Canada; Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, Victoria, BC V8W 3N5, Canada",,"Hetherington, R (corresponding author), Univ Victoria, Dept Geog, Victoria, BC V8W 3N5, Canada.",reneeh@ocean.seos.uvic.ca,,,,,,76,23,23,0,20,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0008-4301,1480-3283,,CAN J ZOOL,Can.

Location Cerro de Los Inocentes, 1000 m above sea level, Alexander Selkirk Island (33degrees45'S, 80degrees45'W), Chile. The westernmost island of the Juan Fernandez Archipelago, south-east Pacific Ocean. Methods A 150-cm long sediment core comprising 87 cm dark brown peat overlying 63 cm of yellow grey clay was extracted from a shallow depression on the southern slopes of Cerro de Los Inocentes. Pollen, charcoal, sediment and accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon analyses were used to construct a record of vegetation change through time. Numerical analysis of multispecies data allowed the classification of fossil assemblages into distinct pollen zones. Results Pollen and spores are preserved throughout the sediment with high concentrations coinciding with the beginning of organic sediment accumulation at around 8000 (14) C yr BP. Prior to 8000 (14) C yr BP, the deposition of clays, presumably from upslope erosion, occurred in a landscape sparsely vegetated by grasses, ferns and Pernettya rigida heath, including several plants that are only found 100-200 m above the site today (Zone CI-1). After 8000 (14) C yr BP, a P. rigida heath was the dominant vegetation (Zone CI-2). A shift to a wet heath-shrubland (Zone CI-3) occurred at 6000 (14) C yr BP and was followed by a transition to a treefern-shrubland mosaic accompanied by periodic burning (Zone CI-4) after 4500 (14) C yr BP. The impact of human occupation is evident in Zone CI-5 at 450 (14) C yr BP with the loss of forest species, increased burning and invasion of the exotic plant Rumex . Main conclusions The pollen and charcoal record provides the first evidence of vegetation changes spanning at least the last 8000 (14) C yr BP from the high altitude environment of Alexander Selkirk Island. Prior to 8000 (14) C yr BP, the altitudinal ranges of different plant species may have been suppressed by a cooler and drier climate. Increasing precipitation and temperatures at the end of the last glacial period may have mobilized exposed sediments in a sparsely vegetated upland environment, altering local drainage patterns, eventually leading to slope stabilization and deposition of organic detritus under an increasing density of heath and shrub vegetation. The subalpine heath-shrubland persisted until 4500 (14) C yr BP when first evidence for sustained burning is found in association with the establishment of a more open treefern-shrubland vegetation pattern. In the absence of human occupation at this time, the influence of increased climatic variability associated with more frequent El Nino-Southern Oscillation events during the mid to late Holocene is considered one of the main driving forces behind increased vegetation disturbance during this period. The record provides evidence that island vegetation patterns have been highly dynamic over millennial to decadal time-scales and that the flora has persisted through periods of rapid and major climate change. This changed with the discovery of the island by European explorers in the late sixteenth century and the subsequent introduction of goats and exploitation and burning of forests, which resulted in the progressive destruction of native vegetation and the invasion of introduced plants. There is evidence that reduced burning and control of the goat population within the last 50 years has resulted in marginal recovery of some high altitude native plant species.","Monash Univ, Sch Geog & Environm Sci, Clayton, Vic 3168, Australia",,"Haberle, SG (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Pacific & Asian Studies, Dept Archaeol & Nat Hist, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,"Haberle, Simon/U-4118-2019","Haberle, Simon/0000-0001-5802-6535",,,,49,24,25,1,22,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0305-0270,,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

Arid biomes are well represented in SSA today, but were and biomes similarly important in the geologic past? How long in time can be found major and biomes in SSA? With the aim of replaying these questions, in this paper we summarized the paleoenvironmental changes of SSA through Cenozoic, emphasizing the relationships between biomes and the geological forces that, through different climatic-environmental factors, have driven its evolution. We define SSA the south of the 15 degrees S area. We prefer this geographical delimitation because with it we can see and follow the history of the biogeographic (historic and ecologic) relationships of Patagonian biota with the rest of the South American biota. Additionally, with this delimitation we possess the most complete Cenozoic South American land-mammal fossil record. We use biomes because biomes are taxon-free analytical units, and their pattern of change can be traced through time independently of the taxa present at different geological periods. Data on plate tectonics, volcanism, sea-level changes, marine pal eo temperatures, and glaciations were taken from literature. To analyse the pattern of change of southern South American climates and environments through the Cenozoic, we used the fossil record of land-mammals as information source. When available, the record of vascular plants were used to contrast the inferences derived from land-mammals. Finally, we used standard geologic divisions (i.e. Epochs) as chronological units. The main conclusion of this paper is that from Early Paleocene to Late Pleistocene, southern South American climatic conditions changed from warm, wet, and non-seasonal, to colder, dryer, and seasonal. Concomitantly, biomes changed from tropical forest to steppes, across a sequence constituted by subtropical forests, woodland savanna, park-savanna, and grassland savanna. During the Quaternary, and as a consequence of glacial cycles, cold and dry conditions were interrupted by warmer and wet periods. Accordingly, several pulses of expansion and retraction of steppes (and, concomitantly, advances and retreats of the northern tropical forests) are recorded. This cyclic pattern of changes produced the provincialism that has characterized the South American biota from Early Pleistocene to the present. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Alternatively, these plants represent populations that became established because of independent chance dispersal events. Location This study focuses on the area east of the Rocky Mountain Continental Divide in the Province of Alberta and the State of Montana in western Canada and USA, respectively. Methods Disjunct species were identified and their distributions mapped based on a review of occurrence maps and records, botanical floras and checklists, herbaria specimens, ecological and botanical studies, and field surveys of selected species. A disjunct species was defined as a plant population separated from its next nearest occurrence by a distance of > 300 km. Evaluation of the hypothesis was based on a review of published and unpublished pollen stratigraphy and palaeoecological studies. The potential geographical distribution of Hypsithermal vegetation was based on modern regional-based ecosystem mapping and associated monthly temperature summaries as well as future climatic warming models. Results The hypothesis was compatible with Holocene pollen stratigraphy, Hypsithermal permafrost and fen occurrence, and palaeosol phytolith analyses; and future global climatic warming models. Modelled regional Hypsithermal vegetation based on a 1degreesC increase in July temperatures relative to current conditions, indicated that much of the boreal forest zone in Alberta could have been grassland, which would explain the occurrence of Prairie species in the Peace River District. This amount of latitudinal vegetation shift (6.5degrees) was similar to an earlier Hypsithermal permafrost zone location study. An equivalent shift in vegetation along the eastern Cordillera would have placed south-western Montana-like vegetation and species such as Boykinia heucheriformis (Rydb.) Rosend. and Saxifraga odontoloma Piper within the northern half of the Rocky Mountains and foothills in Alberta, which represents the location of modern-day disjunct populations of these species. Main conclusions Warmer and drier climatic conditions during the Holocene Hypsithermal resulted in the northward displacement of vegetation zones relative to their current distribution patterns. Most of Alberta was probably dominated by grasslands during this period, except the Rocky Mountains and northern highlands. Modern-day species disjunctions within the Rocky Mountains and Peace River District as well as more northerly areas such as the Yukon Territory occurred when the vegetation receded southward in response to climatic cooling after the Hypsithermal. Wind dispersal was considered an unlikely possibility to explain the occurrence of the disjunct species, as most of the plants lack morphological adaptations for long distance transport and the prevailing winds were from west to east rather than south to north. However, consumption and transport of seeds by northward migrating birds could not be excluded as a possibility.","Univ Calgary, Fac Environm Design, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; Univ Calgary, Dept Geol & Geophys, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada",,"Strong, WL (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Fac Environm Design, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",strong@ucalgary.ca,,,,,,75,16,20,1,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-0270,1365-2699,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

(2000) Nature 405, 65-69]. In the present paper the stratigraphy, facies types and faunal composition from 25 measured sections of the tool-bearing Abdur Reef Limestone (ARL) are documented in detail and interpreted to provide a palaeoenvironmental context for the stone artefacts and a model for the deposition of the ARL. The ARL represents a complex marine terrace sequence. Erosional surfaces indicative of interrupted sedimentation are locally observed at two levels within the ARL. They subdivide the complex into three subunits, named 5e(1), 5e(2), and 5e(3), representing different stages of the marine isotope stage 5e sea level highstand, comprising six depositional phases (I-VI) of the ARL. Subunit 5e, begins with the initial transgression of the 5e sea level highstand leading to the deposition of widespread lag gravels on which rich oyster beds developed in shallow water (phase I). It further records rapid deepening accompanied by the deposition of low-energy carbonates with scarce corals (phase II), and later shoaling characterised by local development of a fringing reef tract in a sedimented environment (phase III). Subunit 5e(1) is capped locally by a burrowed hardground that is laterally equivalent to depositional discontinuities, interpreted as caused by a globally recognised mid-5e sea level low stand (phase IV). Extensive reef build-up in response to sea level rise and improved conditions for coral growth characterises subunit 5e(2) (phase V). A possible second sea level drop during the 5e highstand is inferred from the oyster-encrusted upper surface of subunit 5e(2). Subunit 5e(3) encompasses restricted coral patches that developed on the upper surface of the underlying subunit during the last stage of the 5e marine high stand (phase VI). Two different toolkits are found in the ARL. One consists of bifacial hand axes and cores of the Acheulian industry, typically associated with the oyster beds encrusted on the transgressive lag deposits. The other consists of Middle Stone Age (MSA)-type obsidian flakes and blades, mainly found in the nearshore and beach environments alongside debris from marine invertebrates and large land mammals. The distribution of these tools suggests that foraging activities of early humans varied with environmental setting. The Abdur Archaeological Site represents a late example of the Acheulian/MSA transition, seen as a benchmark for early modem human behaviour, and is, to date, the earliest well-dated example of early human adaptation to marine food resources.

Should the lower boundary of the Quaternary coincide with the base of the Gelasian Stage (2.6 Ma) as proposed by the ICS? If so, should the Quaternary and Pleistocene lower boundaries be the same or should be different? To contribute to the debate, the Villafranchian large mammal fossil record from the North-Western Mediterranean region have been revised in order to correlate the diversity and structural dynamics of reconstructed faunal complexes with the changes in environmental conditions occurring from the Middle Pliocene to the Early Pleistocene. According to the results obtained, two major faunal renewals are detectable at the transition from the early to middle Villafranchian [similar to 2.7-2.5 Ma, about at the time of the transition from the Middle (Zanclean Stage) to the Late Pliocene (Gelasian Stage)], and from the middle to late Villafranchian (similar to 2.0-similar to 1.9 Ma, shortly before the official Plio-Pleistocene boundary). The faunal renewal from the early (V1) to the middle (V2) Villafranchian faunal complexes (that means from the MN16a zone/Triversa FU to MN16b zone/Montopoli FU) is linked to the Middle Pliocene climate worsening, in turn related to the onset of bipolar glaciations followed by glacial-interglacial cycles of moderate amplitude (orbital periodicity of 41 ka). The resulting increase in aridity and more intense seasonality caused the disappearance of several forest-dwelling taxa, especially small carnivores and arboreal -scansorial taxa, whereas new large grazers, mixed feeders or even browsers appeared. This renewal (already called the Equus-elephant event) can be regarded as a true turnover phase, due to the high percentage of last and new appearances, and to the important ecological structural changes in faunal complexes, involving mainly the herbivore guild. These faunal changes indicate that forests or woodlands gradually gave way to more open environments (including Artemisia steppe) alternating with warm-temperate deciduous forests. Moreover, this event can be considered as the starting point for a dispersal phase leading to a progressive standing richness increase during the following Pliocene (middle Villafranchian, V3). Around 2.0-1.8 Ma (late Villafranchian, V4), despite the extinction of some small browsing and grazing ruminants, diversity notably increased due to the progressive appearance of a number of carnivores. Indeed, the so-called wolf-event involved several large and small Carnivora, such as the powerful scavenger Pachycrocuta brevirostris, the jaguar-like Panthera gombazsoegensis, and cooperative foraging canids. On the other hand, minor phyletic adjustments and some new appearances (especially grazers) affected herbivore guild. This relatively long dispersal phase, and correlated moderate turnover pulses, seems to be less important than the early/middle Villafranchian renewal phase, especially as far as France and the Italian peninsula are concerned. As a result, taking into account the importance of faunal renewal at the Middle to Late Pliocene transition, it seems more reasonable to extend the base of the Pleistocene downwards from 1.81 Ma (official Plio/Pleistocene boundary) to 2.6 Ma (base of Pliocene Gelasian Stage). Accordingly, the base of the Gelasian seems to be the most apropriate lower boundary for both the Quaternary Period and Pleistocene Epoch.","Inst Geol Ambientale & Geoingn, CNR, Dept Sci Terra, I-00185 Rome, Italy",,"Palombo, MR (corresponding author), Inst Geol Ambientale & Geoingn, CNR, Dept Sci Terra, Pizzale A Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",rnariarita.palombo@uniromal.it,,"Palombo, Maria Rita/0000-0002-2104-2176",,,,108,19,19,0,8,SOC GEOLOGIQUE FRANCE,PARIS,"77, RUE CLAUDE-BERNARD, PARIS, F-75005, FRANCE",1142-2904,,,QUATERNAIRE,Quaternaire,MAR,2007,18,1,,,,,35,53,,,,,19,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Geology,200XT,WOS:000248796800006,,,,,2022-02-14
